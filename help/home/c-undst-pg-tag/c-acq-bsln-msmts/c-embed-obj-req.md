# Acquiring Embedded Object Requests (Page Tags){#acquiring-embedded-object-requests-page-tags}

After the HTML of a page is requested by a browser, the browser requests the embedded objects referenced in the HTML of that page from a web server to fill in the page shown by the browser.

Such embedded object requests are most commonly requests for image files or JavaScript files, though there are hundreds or maybe thousands of types of embedded objects used on the Internet today. Many of these embedded object requests are not generally useful in analyzing or reporting on the business activity of an Internet site; many such requests are therefore not desirable for acquisition unless they have a specific business purpose, such as presenting an advertisement or taking another measurement of site activity.

For example, an image may be an advertisement, and you may want to know that the advertisement was impressed upon a visitor. A JavaScript snippet may be in use to take a measurement that the particular browser has a certain characteristic and pass it back to a [!DNL Sensor] for acquisition. Each page on a site may have 10 or 100 embedded object requests in it. If a site stores the log information for each of these requests, the amount of data storage needed to keep the log data available for future analysis is multiplied by the number of embedded object requests for each page requested. For this reason, [!DNL Site] lets you keep the requests that are important for analysis and discard others before you incur unnecessary storage costs.

By using the override feature provided in the content-type filtering capabilities of [!DNL Sensor] (appending “Log=1” to the query string of an embedded object request URL), that particular embedded object request and the related measurement data can be acquired without requiring the site manager to store all requests of that type (for example, all `<image>` requests).

[!DNL Sensor] collects the measurement data in the following table for each embedded object request made of the web server, assuming that [!DNL Sensor] is not configured to filter it out or that the filter has been overridden. The collected information is related to the visitor and session and subsequent sessions through the x-trackingid or cs(cookie) log field entries.
