# Performing Controlled Experiments{#performing-controlled-experiments}

Sensor enables controlled website experimentation, allowing you to run controlled experiments on random subsets of your visitor population with minimal disruption to your ongoing operations.

 Controlled experiments allow experimentation with hypotheses for improving website financial performance, improving customer experience, or influencing customer behavior. Marketing programs, content personalization initiatives, process flows, and creative or content concept hypotheses can be tested on a controlled percentage of randomly selected site visitors and then analyzed in data workbench to determine the merit of the hypotheses.
