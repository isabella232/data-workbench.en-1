# About Built-in Metrics, Dimensions, and Filters{#about-built-in-metrics-dimensions-and-filters}

This section provides detailed information about the built-in metrics, dimensions, and filters provided in data workbench.

Almost all metrics are defined in the metrics directory of a profile. A few built-in metrics are provided to convey technical information about the status of data processing through its two phases called log processing and transformation which are defined by Insight Server's log processing and transformation configuration files, respectively.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The log processing phase does not mean that all event data comes from log files. Although it sometimes does, event data can come from another source, such as an ODBC data source. For more information about data sources, see the [Dataset Configuration Guide](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/data-workbench/using/dataset/c-dataset-constr.html).
