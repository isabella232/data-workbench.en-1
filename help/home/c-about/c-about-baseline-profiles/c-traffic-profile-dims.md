# Traffic Profile Dimensions{#traffic-profile-dimensions}

The Traffic profile contains the following dimensions to help identify visitor actions.

The dimensions in the following table are defined in the transformation dataset include files in the Traffic\Dataset\Transformation directory.

|  Name  | Type  | Level  | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  Day  | Simple  | Session  | The day of the first log entry of the session.  |
|  Day of Week  | Simple  | Session  | The day of week of the first log entry of a session.  |
|  Exact Page Duration (Hidden)  | Numeric  | Page View  | The duration in milliseconds of page view as measured by subtracting the time of the next page view from the time of that page view. The exact duration of the last page view in a session is always 0.  |
|  Hour  | Simple  | Session  | The hour of the first log entry of a session.  |
|  Hour of Day  | Simple  | Session  | The hour of day of the first log entry of a session.  |
|  Month  | Simple  | Session  | The month of the first log entry of a session.  |
|  Page View  | Countable  | Session  | A log entry or “Event Data Record” satisfying the Page View Condition.  |
|  Referrer  | Simple  | Session  | The second level domain of the referrer of the first log entry of the session (or None if it is an internal referrer domain).  |
|  Session  | Countable  | Visitor  |A period of related contiguous activity by a Visitor. It is delimited by a 30-minute period of inactivity and an external referrer domain or a maximum 48-hour Session Duration. Both of those timeouts and the set of domains that are considered internal can be configured in the [!DNL Transformation.cfg] file.  |
|  URI  | Simple  | Page View  | The URI stem of a page view. The URI dimension can be redefined using the ReplaceURI, PrependURI, and AppendURI transformations.  |
|  Visitor  | Countable  | N/A  | A unique value of x-trackingid. Usually corresponds to a unique browser if persistent cookies are used. The x-trackingid can be otherwise based on IP number or some other unique identifier such as x.509 common name.  |
|  Week  | Simple  | Session  | The week of the first log entry of a session.  |
