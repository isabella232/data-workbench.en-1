# The Transform.cfg File{#the-transform-cfg-file}

The data workbenchTransform.cfg file contains the parameters that define the log sources, data transformations, and exporters.

The transformations that you define manipulate raw data collected by Sensors ( [!DNL .vsl] files) or contained in text files, XML files, or ODBC-compliant databases and output them either into existing fields, overwriting the current data, or into newly defined fields.

To configure transformation functionality, you edit the data workbench [!DNL Transform.cfg] file within the Dataset folder for the profile for which you want to export event data. Typically, this profile is dedicated to transformation functionality (that is, you perform no other data processing than what is defined in the data workbench [!DNL Transform.cfg] file). It is important to note that any processing instructions specified in the [!DNL Log Processing Dataset Include] files for any inherited profiles are applied in addition to those specified in the data workbench [!DNL Transform.cfg] file.

For information about dataset include files, see [Dataset Include Files](../../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-dataset-inc-files/c-abt-dataset-inc-files.md).

If the data that you want to export is processed by a data workbench server cluster, each of the processing servers (DPUs) in the cluster processes the data, but only the first DPU (processing server #0 in the [!DNL profile.cfg] file) will write the output data to its local file system.

**To edit the data workbench Transform.cfg file** 

1. While working in the profile for which you want to export data, open the [!DNL Profile Manager] and click **[!UICONTROL Dataset]** to show the contents of the directory.
1. Right-click the check mark next to data workbench [!DNL Transform.cfg], then click **[!UICONTROL Make Local]**. A check mark for this file appears in the [!DNL User] column.
1. Right-click the newly created check mark and click **[!UICONTROL Open]** > **[!UICONTROL from the workbench]**. The data workbench [!DNL Transform.cfg] window appears.
1. Edit the parameters in the configuration file using the table below as a guide:

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >If additional data is received after the output files are closed (see [!DNL Log Sources] and [!DNL Offline Mode] in the preceding table), [!DNL Transform] creates new output files with the additional data. The names of the new output files are generated from the original output file's name with the addition of a parenthesized version number just before the extension. For example, if the original output file is [!DNL 20070701-ABC.vsl], subsequent versions of this file will be named [!DNL 20070701-ABC(1).vsl], [!DNL 20070701-ABC(2).vsl], and so on. Note that using the versioned files as input to the data workbench server may result in processing errors. 
  >
  >
  >Adobe recommends avoiding the creation of versioned output files by making sure that all source data is in chronological order within lexicographically ordered input files and, if [!DNL Offline Mode] is set to true, that all source data is present before processing starts. For more information, see the [!DNL Log Sources] and [!DNL Offline Mode] entries in the preceding table.

1. Add transformations by right-clicking **[!UICONTROL Transformations]** and clicking **[!UICONTROL Add new]** > **[!UICONTROL Transformation type]**. Complete the transformation fields.

   See [Data Transformations](../../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-data-trans/c-abt-transf.md) for descriptions and examples of the transformations that you can use with transformation functionality. 

1. Right-click **[!UICONTROL (modified)]** at the top of the window, then click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
1. To make the locally made changes take effect, in the [!DNL Profile Manager], right-click the check mark for data workbench [!DNL Transform.cfg] in the [!DNL User] column, then click **[!UICONTROL Save to]** >  **[!UICONTROL profile name]**, where profile name is the name of the profile for which you are exporting data. Reprocessing of the data begins after synchronization of the profile.
