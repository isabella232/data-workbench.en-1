# Defining Exporters{#defining-exporters}

Exporters provide the instructions for outputting the event data.

Transformation functionality provides three types of exporters for exporting [!DNL .vsl] files, log files, XML files, and ODBC data as [!DNL .vsl] files, text files, or delimited text files that can be used by DataWarehouse loading routines, auditing agencies, or other targets.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For an exporter to work properly, the log source must meet the appropriate requirements discussed in the [Log Sources](../../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-log-proc-config-file/c-log-sources.md#concept-6714c720fac044cbb9af003bf401b2ea) section of [Log Processing Configuration File](../../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-log-proc-config-file/c-abt-log-proc-config-file.md).

**To define an exporter** 

1. Open [!DNL Transform.cfg] in data workbench. See [To edit the Insight Transform.cfg file](../../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-transf-func/c-config-files-transf/t-ins-transf-file/t-ins-transf-file.md#task-857fc535ccdb4c39b763179efa4b0f13).
1. Right-click **[!UICONTROL Exporters]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Add New]**.
1. Select one of the following options:

    * **[!UICONTROL ExportTextFile]** 
    * **[!UICONTROL ExportDelimitedTextFile]** 
    * **[!UICONTROL ExportVSLFile]**

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >For the [!DNL ExportVSLFile] option, all of the extended fields in the input file and all user-defined fields of the form cs(*header*) are always written to the VSL output file. If you overwrite an existing extended field, the new value is written to the output file, even if the field is blank.

1. Edit the Exporters parameters in the configuration file using the following table as a guide:

   <table id="table_35C380DB6E4F42448C149D5EC185213C">

1. After you have defined your exporter (and made changes to other parameters) in the [!DNL Transform.cfg] file, save the file locally and save it to the appropriate profile on the data workbench server machine.
