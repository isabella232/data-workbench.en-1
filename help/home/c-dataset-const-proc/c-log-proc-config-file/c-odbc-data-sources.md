# ODBC Data Sources{#odbc-data-sources}

The data workbench server (InsightServer64.exe) can read event data from any SQL database (for example, Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server) that has an ODBC 3.0 compliant driver.

 The data workbench server's ODBC support is similar to existing support for loading data from Sensors or from log files generated by external processes. There are, however, some additional considerations and limitations:

* The data workbench server's ODBC support is compatible with the clustering capabilities. Data is distributed among all processing servers, and all subsequent processing (including query processing) benefits fully from clustering. 
* ODBC support depends on third-party ODBC drivers. For ODBC support to work, these drivers must be configured on the machine on which the data workbench server runs, using tools external to the Adobe platform. Data workbench machines do not require any additional configuration. 
* The table or view from which data is loaded must have an increasing ID column. For any row, the value in this column (which may be an actual column in the table or any SQL column expression) must not decrease as new rows are inserted into the database. If this constraint is violated, data is lost. For adequate performance, an index is required on this column or column expression.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >It is possible for multiple rows to have the same value in the [!DNL Increasing ID] column. One possibility is a timestamp column with less than perfect precision.

* The data workbench server cannot load columns with long data (data above a certain length as determined by the specific database application in use). 
* Retrieving data from a database is slower than reading it from a disk file. Datasets that load data from an ODBC source take much longer to process (particularly when reprocessing) than equivalently sized datasets whose data comes from Sensors or other disk files.

For information about reprocessing your data, see [Reprocessing and Retransformation](../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-reproc-retrans/c-reproc-retrans.md#concept-6d82a173e4ab4111b673e7c2477d0823).

**To configure Insight Server for ODBC [!DNL event data]**

Configuring the data workbench server to load data from an SQL database requires that you first perform the following steps in order:

1. Install the appropriate database client software, including an ODBC driver, on the data workbench server machine on which the dataset is processed.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you are loading ODBC event data for processing on a data workbench server cluster, you must install the database client software on all of the processing servers in the cluster. For information about specifying processing servers in a cluster, see the *Server Products Installation and Administration Guide*.

1. Configure a Data Source using the ODBC Data Source Administrator for Windows.

   It is important to note that the data workbench server (InsightServer64.exe) runs as a Windows service. Therefore, the Data Source ordinarily must be configured as a System DSN rather than a User DSN for the data workbench server to be able to use it. You can find more information about this configuration step in the documentation for your database software.

After installing the database client software on the appropriate data workbench server machine, you can configure the dataset to use the ODBC data source by editing the appropriate parameters in the [!DNL Log Processing] configuration file for the desired profile.

## Parameters {#section-15c0218d93364693a565f2609a12f73e}

For data from databases using the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) standard, the following parameters are available:

This example shows the [!DNL Log Processing] configuration window in data workbench with an ODBC data source. This Data Source takes data from a table called [!DNL VISUAL.VSL] in a database with [!DNL Data Source Name] "VSTestO." Five (5) column objects ( [!DNL Fields]) map data from the data columns in the database to the data workbench server.
