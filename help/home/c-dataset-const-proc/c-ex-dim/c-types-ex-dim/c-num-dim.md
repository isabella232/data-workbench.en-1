# Numeric Dimensions{#numeric-dimensions}

A numeric dimension consists of ordered, numerical elements and has a one-to-many relationship with its parent countable dimension.

 You can think of a numeric dimension as a representation of the numeric properties of the parent dimension's elements. For example, if you are working with web data, you could define the numeric dimension Session Revenue, which defines an amount of revenue, in dollars, for each session in the Session dimension. Each session has a single amount of associated revenue, but several sessions can have the same amount of associated revenue. Therefore, the Session Revenue dimension has a one-to-many relationship with the Session dimension.

Numeric dimensions are often used to define metrics that sum values, count occurrences of a condition, or locate a minimum or maximum value. For example, a metric named "Revenue" might be defined using the Session Revenue dimension: sum(Session_Revenue, Session). Defined this way, the Revenue metric would give the total amount of revenue for the selected sessions.

Numeric dimensions cannot be parents of other dimensions.

Numeric dimensions are defined by the following parameters:

<table id="table_15B849DD0BFC4D57AD6CF28898901324">

  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Clip Values </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> True or false. Specifies whether the input value (after Operation ) is to be clipped to be between the values of Min and Max. If Clip Values is true, the value is clipped to that range. If Clip Values is false, no value is returned for the element of the parent dimension. </td>

   <td colname="col2"> Determines whether the dimension appears in the data workbench interface. By default, this parameter is set to false.

>If [!DNL Operation] yields no value, or [!DNL Clip Values] is false and the value is not between [!DNL Min] and [!DNL Max], no element of the numeric dimension is related to the element of the parent dimension.

This example illustrates the definition of a numeric dimension using event data collected from website traffic. This numeric dimension, named "Ad View Counter," counts the number of times that the visitor sees an advertisement during a given session. The assumption is that all advertisement resources are requested from the web server with ad= as part of the cs-uri-query. In the example, the number of times (COUNT) that the visitor is presented with an advertisement is the value of interest, not the actual value in the field.
