# Time Dimensions{#time-dimensions}

A time dimension enables you to create a set of periodic or absolute local time dimensions (such as Day, Day of Week, Hour of Day, Reservation Time, and so on) based on any timestamp field that you specify for the Input Time (1970 epoch) parameter.

 When defining time dimensions, you also can choose a day other than Monday to be used as the start of a week by specifying the Week Start Day parameter. You can define more than one set of time dimensions in your dataset as long as the dimensions have different names.

Time dimensions are defined by the following parameters:

<table id="table_9734F6CD7ABA4661A2F9A5FB948A7282"> 
 <thead>

   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Parameter </th>

   <td colname="col2"> Determines whether the dimension appears in the data workbench interface. By default, this parameter is set to false.

   <td colname="col3"> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Parent </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> The name of the parent dimension. Any countable dimension can be a parent dimension. For web data, the parent is Session. </td>

  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Week Start Day </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>The day to use as the first day of a week. </p> <p> This parameter affects the Week dimension, the Day of Week dimension, and any reporting time dimensions defined in terms of weeks. </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col3"> Mon </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

This example creates a set of time dimensions based on the user-defined input field x-time-1970. The set of time dimensions is named "Session Time." Because the parent of each dimension is the Session dimension, each element of the time dimensions corresponds to the time at which a session began. The Week Start Day parameter specifies that each week of the Week dimension starts on Monday.
