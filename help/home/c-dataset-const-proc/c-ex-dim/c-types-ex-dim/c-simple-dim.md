# Simple Dimensions{#simple-dimensions}

A simple dimension has a one-to-many relationship with its parent countable dimension.

 A simple dimension is always a child of a countable dimension. You can think of a simple dimension as a representation of a property of the elements in its parent dimension. For example, if you are working with web data, you could define the Visitor Referrer dimension, which is a simple dimension with a parent dimension of Visitor. It represents the first HTTP referrer for each visitor in the Visitor dimension. Each visitor in the Visitor dimension has only one visitor referrer, but many visitors can have the same visitor referrer. Therefore, the Visitor Referrer dimension has a one-to-many relationship with the Visitor dimension.

Simple dimensions are defined by the following parameters:

<table id="table_E6F729DFA226459DBFC1776CE8CB81F8"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Parameter </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Description </th> 
   <th colname="col3" class="entry"> Default </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Name </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> Descriptive name of the dimension as it appears in data workbench. The dimension name cannot include a hyphen (-). </td> 
   <td colname="col3"> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Comments </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> Optional. Notes about the extended dimension. </td> 
   <td colname="col3"> </td> 
  </tr>

  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> Hidden </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> Determines whether the dimension appears in the data workbench interface. By default, this parameter is set to false. If, for example, the dimension is to be used only as the basis of a metric, you can set this parameter to true to hide the dimension from the data workbench display. </td>

This example illustrates the definition of a simple dimension using event data collected from website traffic and a load file.

Consider the example of a poll of site visitors' favorite Girl Scout cookies. A web page captures this vote and returns it to the web server in the name-value pair favoritecookie. Only one vote per visitor is counted, but visitors can change their minds and vote again if desired. This is a one-to-many relationship: one visitor can have many votes, but each vote is associated with only one visitor. Therefore, the parent of the dimension is visitors (only one vote per visitor) and the operation is LAST ROW (so that they can change their minds and vote again).

Placeholders must exist for all types of cookies so that cookie types receiving no votes appears in the data workbench display. For these reasons, a load file has been defined that contains the list of cookie types that may be selected. This file's contents, saved in a file named [!DNL cookietypes.txt], looks something like the following:

Animal Treasures

Caramel Delights

Lemon Pastry Creams

Peanut Butter Patties

Shortbreads

Thin Mints

The final dimension is defined as shown here:
