# Sessionize{#sessionize}

If you are working with data collected from website traffic, you can use the Sessionize transformation to determine how sessions are defined.

 The transformation takes as its input a timestamp and a tracking ID and outputs a session number for each log entry. The session number is "1" for the first session with a given tracking ID, "2" for the second session with the same tracking ID, and so on. The output can be used directly as a session key because it has a unique value for each session.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To work, the [!DNL Sessionize] transformation requires that the data is ordered in time and grouped by the tracking ID in your source data. Therefore, [!DNL Sessionize] works only when defined in the [!DNL Transformation.cfg] file or in a [!DNL Transformation Dataset Include] file.

A new session begins when any one of the following situations occurs:

* The tracking ID changes. 
* The time since the last log entry is at least equal to the value of the Session Timeout parameter and the Timeout Condition is satisfied. 
* The time since the first log entry of the last session exceeds the value of the Maximum Session Duration parameter.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you have already defined Maximum Session Duration and Session Timeout as parameters in the [!DNL Session Parameters.cfg] file, do not enter values for them in the configuration. You can reference the parameters by typing *$(parameter name)* as shown in the following example. For more information about these parameters, see [Configuration Settings for Web Data](../../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-config-web-data/c-config-web-data.md#concept-9a306b65483a484bb3f6f3c1d7e77519).

The [!DNL Sessionize] transformation in this example takes as its input the x-timestamp and x-trackingid fields and records the session number for each log entry in the x-session-key field. The transformation's [!DNL Timeout Condition] is based on a [!DNL Neither] condition: If the cs(referrer-domain) field for a log entry matches a member of the Internal Domains parameter, the condition evaluates to false. Note the references to the Internal Domains and Session Timeout parameters.

For information about the [!DNL NeitherCondition], see [Conditions](../../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-conditions/c-abt-cond.md). For information about the Internal Domains and Session Timeout parameters, see [Configuration Settings for Web Data](../../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-config-web-data/c-config-web-data.md#concept-9a306b65483a484bb3f6f3c1d7e77519).
