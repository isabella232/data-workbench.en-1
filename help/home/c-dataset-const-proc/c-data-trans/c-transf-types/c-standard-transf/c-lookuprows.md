# LookupRows{#lookuprows}

The LookupRows transformation looks at other log entries with the same tracking ID and sets the value of the output field to the value of a designated field in the input row.

Because the [!DNL LookupRows] transformation performs its lookup on log entries and not lookup files, it is very similar to the [!DNL CrossRows] transformation. See [CrossRows](../../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-data-trans/c-transf-types/c-standard-transf/c-crossrows.md#concept-fcace08804f54db397ed631cc13ff4f2).

To work, the [!DNL LookupRows] transformation requires that the data is ordered in time and grouped by the tracking ID in your source data. Therefore, [!DNL LookupRows] works only when defined in the [!DNL Transformation.cfg] file or in a [!DNL Transformation Dataset Include] file.

As you review the descriptions of the parameters in the following table, remember the following:

* The output row is the row of data that the transformation is working on at a given point in time. 
* Input rows are all of the other rows of data (before, after, or including the output row) whose values of the input field serve as inputs to the transformation.

The Input Row Key Input, Input Row Value Input, and Input Condition parameters together define the lookup file for each tracking ID, while the Output Row Key Input, Output Row Value Input, and Condition parameters control what is looked up in the file and what value is stored in the field specified by Output Row Value Output.

To better understand the operation of the transformation, consider the following outline:

* For each output row satisfying the Condition and having a nonempty Output Row Key Input:

    * Find the FIRST or LAST input row such that

        * the input row satisfies the Input Condition, and 
        * the x-trackingid of the input row equals the x-trackingid of the output row, and 
        * the Input Row Key Input of the input row equals the Output Row Key Input of the output row,

* and set the Output Row Value Output of the output row to the Input Row Value Input of the input row.

Considerations for [!DNL LookupRows]

* Blank key values never match anything. Even if there are input rows with blank keys and nonblank values that match the [!DNL Input Condition], an [!DNL Output Row Key Input] of "" will always produce an [!DNL Output Row Value Output] of "". 

* If not forbidden by the [!DNL Input Condition], a row may look up itself if its [!DNL Input Row Key Input] and [!DNL Output Row Key Input] values are the same.

If you have multiple key values, you can combine them using a [!DNL Format] transformation (see [Format](../../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-data-trans/c-transf-types/c-standard-transf/c-format.md#concept-3de04869181e4694ab072b092186684b)) before applying a [!DNL LookupRows] transformation.

Suppose that you have a website that has a pet registration page, where the name and the breed are entered, and a later "buy toy" page where only the name of the pet is used. You would like to be able to link the pet name with the pet breed entered on the registration page. To do so, you could create the following [!DNL LookupRows] transformation:

Let's analyze this example using the previous outline:

* For each output row satisfying having a nonempty value of cs-uri-query(petname) :

    * Find the LAST input row such that

        * the input row contains a nonempty value of cs-uri-query(petbreed), and 
        * the x-trackingid of the input row equals the x-trackingid of the output row, and 
        * the value of cs-uri-query(petname) of the input row equals the value of cs-uri-query(petname) of the output row,

* and set the value of x-pet-breed of the output row to the value of cs-uri-query(petbreed) of the input row.

The [!DNL LookupRows] transformation uses the pet name (the key) to make sure that the pet breed is linked to both the pet registration and buy toy pages so that you can analyze the toys bought for each breed of pet, even for visitors with multiple pets.
