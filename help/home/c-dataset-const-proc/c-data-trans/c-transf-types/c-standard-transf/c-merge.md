The Merge transformation takes the values from the input field (typically a vector of strings), combines them into a single string separated by the given delimiter, and places the resulting string in the given output field.

In this example, an input vector of strings is assumed to contain a set of products that were selected for purchase. These products are placed into a single output string and are separated by "::" (two colons).

So if the input field x-products contained the string values B57481, C46355, and Z97123, the resulting output string x-show-products would be B57481::C46355::Z97123.
