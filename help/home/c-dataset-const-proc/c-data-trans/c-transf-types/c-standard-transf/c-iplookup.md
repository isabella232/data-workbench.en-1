# IPLookup{#iplookup}

The IPLookup transformation takes IP geo-location or IP geo-intelligence data (provided by any vendor of such data and converted into a proprietary format by Adobe) and transforms the data into geographical information that can be used in analysis.

Two [!DNL IPLookup] transformations are listed in the Add new > *Transformation type *menu:

* [!DNL IPLookup] Quova for [!DNL IP geo-location] data 

* [!DNL IPLookup] Digital Envoy for [!DNL IP geo-intelligence] data

When defining an [!DNL IPLookup] transformation, choose the appropriate transformation for your [!DNL IP geo-location] or [!DNL IP geo-intelligence] data.

In this example, [!DNL IP geo-location] data (in the lookup file [!DNL Quova.bin]) is used to create the output fields listed. The outputs (AOL, ASN, Area Code, and so on) can be used to create dimensions for geographical analysis of visitor traffic.
