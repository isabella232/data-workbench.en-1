The Unescape URI transformation unescapes any characters in a string that have been escaped.

If the docname value were

* [!DNL mysite.net/lending%20and%20leasing%20forms/document%20library/credit%20application.doc]

then the value of x-docname-unescape would be

* [!DNL mysite.net/lending and leasing forms/document library/credit application.doc]
