# Defining Lookup Transformations{#defining-lookup-transformations}

Information about the transformations that you can use to incorporate lookup data into the dataset.

 Note that not all types can be used during both phases of the dataset construction process.

## Categorize {#section-8474376c14e54d14ae73749696ada468}

The [!DNL Categorize] transformation uses a two-column lookup table composed of pattern-string/value pairs. During this transformation, the data workbench server reads each event data record in turn and compares the contents of a designated field in the record to each of the pattern strings listed in the first column of the lookup table. If the designated field matches one of the pattern strings, the data workbench server writes the value (found in the second column) that is associated with that pattern string to a designated output field in the record.

The strings in the first column of the lookup table optionally can start with the ^ character and/or end in the $ character to force matching at the beginning and/or end. This transformation does not accept regular expressions for defining match conditions in the first column. If the input value is a vector of strings, each string is run through the transformation and the result(s) are appended to an output string vector.

A [!DNL Categorize] transformation is generally easier and faster than using a [!DNL Regular Expression] transformation to accomplish the same thing.

>[!NOTE]

>The substring test used in [!DNL Categorize] is case-sensitive unless otherwise specified using the [!DNL Case Sensitive] parameter.

**Considerations for Categorize**

* Changes to lookup files in [!DNL Categorize] transformations defined in the [!DNL Transformation.cfg] file or in a [!DNL Transformation Dataset Include] file require retransformation of the dataset. Lookup files for [!DNL Categorize] transformations defined in the [!DNL Log Processing.cfg] file or a [!DNL Log Processing Dataset Include] file are not subject to this limitation. For information about reprocessing your data, see [Reprocessing and Retransformation](../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-reproc-retrans/c-unst-reproc-retrans.md). 

* [!DNL Categorize] transformations defined in the [!DNL Log Processing.cfg] file or a [!DNL Log Processing Dataset Include] file reload their lookup files whenever the lookup files change. Changes are not applied retroactively, but they apply to all log data read after the change takes place.

This example illustrates the use of the [!DNL Categorize] transformation to integrate lookup data with event data collected from website traffic. Suppose that a particular website has business sections, and there is a requirement to be able to look at and make comparisons based on traffic flow and value generated by the different sections. You can create a lookup file that lists the substrings used to identify these different sections.

The lookup file [!DNL Lookups\custommap.txt] contains the following table: 

|  /products/  | Products  |
|---|---|
|  ^/sports/  | Sports  |
|  ^/news/  | News  |
|  ...  | ...  |

This categorization file maps anything containing the string "/products/" to the value "Products," anything starting with "/sports/" to the value "Sports," and anything starting with "/news/" to the value "News." The following categorization transformation uses the value in the cs-uri-stem field as the string within which we are looking for a matching substring. The result of the transformation is placed into the x-custommap field.

![](assets/cfg_TransformationType_Categorize.png)

Assuming that the Multiple Values parameter is set to false, the example would produce the following values for x-custommap given the listed values for cs-uri-stem. 

|  [!DNL cs-uri-stem]  | [!DNL x-custommap]  |
|---|---|
|  [!DNL /sports/news/today.php]  | Sports  |
|  [!DNL /sports/products/buy.php]  | Products  |
|  [!DNL /news/headlines.php]  | News  |
|  [!DNL /news/products/subscribe.php]  | Products  |

The output is based on the order of the substrings in the lookup file. For example, the cs-uri-stem [!DNL /sports/products/buy.php] returns "Products." Although the URI stem starts with "/sports/," the string "/products/" is listed before "/sports/" in the lookup file. If the Multiple Values parameter were set to true, there would be an additional value for x-custommap, as the last example would match two rows in the lookup table: Products and News.

## FlatFileLookup {#section-e09b2eeb96444a859b14f03cdaab31f2}

The [!DNL FlatFileLookup] transformation uses a lookup table composed of any number of columns and rows (although, recall that it resides in memory). During this type of transformation, the data workbench server reads each event data record in turn and compares the contents of a designated field in the record to each of the values in a designated column of the lookup table. If there is a match, the data workbench server writes one or more values from the matching row in the lookup table to one or more designated output fields in the event data record.

The lookup table used during this transformation is populated from a flat file whose location you specify when you define the transformation.

**Considerations for [!DNL FlatFileLookup]**

* Matching the input field to the lookup file is always case-sensitive. 
* Changes to lookup files in [!DNL FlatFileLookup] transformations defined in the [!DNL Transformation.cfg] file or [!DNL Transformation Dataset Include] files require retransformation of the dataset. Lookup files for [!DNL FlatFileLookup] transformations defined in the [!DNL Log Processing.cfg] file or [!DNL Log Processing Dataset Include] files are not subject to this limitation. For information about reprocessing your data, see [Reprocessing and Retransformation](../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-reproc-retrans/c-unst-reproc-retrans.md). 

* [!DNL FlatFileLookup] transformations in the [!DNL Log Processing.cfg] file or [!DNL Log Processing Dataset Include] files reload their lookup files whenever the lookup files change. Changes are not applied retroactively, but they apply to all log data read after the change takes place.

This example illustrates the use of the [!DNL FlatFileLookup] transformation to integrate lookup data with event data collected from website traffic. Suppose that you want to isolate website partners that are routing traffic to the website and transform their partner IDs into more user-friendly names. You then can use the user-friendly names to create extended dimensions and visualizations that map more clearly to the business relationship than the site-to-site relationship used for routing traffic.

The example transformation searches the cs(referrer-query) field for the PartnerID name-value pair, and, if located, the lookup file [!DNL Lookups\partners.txt] is used to compare the PartnerID value against the values in the [!DNL Partner] column of the table. If a row is located, the output field x-partner-name is given the name from the [!DNL PrintName] column of the identified row.

![](assets/cfg_TransformationType_FlatFileLookup.png)

If the lookup table contained the following information: 

|  ID  | Partner  | Started  | PrintName  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  1  | P154  | Aug 21, 1999  | Yahoo  |
|  2  | P232  | July 10, 2000  | Microsoft  |
|  3  | P945  | Jan 12, 2001  | Amazon  |

The following examples would transform as follows:

* If cs(referrer)(PartnerID) returned P232, the field x-partner-name would be given the value "Microsoft." 
* If cs(referrer)(PartnerID) returned P100, the field x-partner-name would be given the value "No Partner." 
* If cs(referrer)(PartnerID) returned nothing, the field x-partner-name would be given the value "No Partner" as specified by the Default parameter.

## ODBCLookup {#section-4dcc3747e42e45c0a057e85f308a83cc}

The [!DNL ODBCLookup] transformation operates like a [!DNL FlatFileLookup] transformation. The only difference is that the lookup table used during this transformation is populated from an ODBC database and not a flat file.

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL ODBCLookup] transformations can be executed only during the transformation phase of the dataset construction process. When possible, Adobe recommends that you use the [!DNL FlatFileLookup] transformation instead of the [!DNL ODBCLookup] transformation. [!DNL FlatFileLookup] transformations are inherently more reliable because they do not depend on the availability of an outside system. Additionally, there is less risk that the lookup table is modified if it resides in a flat file that you control locally.

* The Data Source Name, [!DNL Database User ID], [!DNL Database Password], and Table Identifier parameters are the same as the parameters of the same names that are described for ODBC data sources. See [ODBC Data Sources](../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-log-proc-config-file/c-odbc-data-sources.md#concept-5f2cf635081d44beab826ef5ec8cf4e3). 

* Unlike ODBC data sources, [!DNL ODBCLookup] transformations do not require an increasing ID column. See [ODBC Data Sources](../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-log-proc-config-file/c-odbc-data-sources.md#concept-5f2cf635081d44beab826ef5ec8cf4e3). That is because the contents of the lookup table must not change in any way while the dataset is active. Changes in a lookup table or view can not be detected until retransformation occurs. For information about reprocessing your data, see [Reprocessing and Retransformation](../../../../home/c-dataset-const-proc/c-reproc-retrans/c-unst-reproc-retrans.md).

Suppose that you want to convert outdated DNS records to the updated records. Both sets of records are stored in an SQL database. To perform this task, you would reference a lookup table that is generated from the database and replace the outdated DNS records.

Our example transformation searches the log entries for the s-dns field, and, if located, the lookup table VISUAL.LOOKUP is used to compare the s-dns entry against the entries in the [!DNL OLDDNS] column of the table. If a row is located in the table, the output field s-dns is given the updated DNS record entry from the [!DNL NEWDNS] column of the identified row.
