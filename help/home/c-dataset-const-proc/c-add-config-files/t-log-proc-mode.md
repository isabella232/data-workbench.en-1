# Log Processing Mode.cfg{#log-processing-mode-cfg}

The configuration file Log Processing Mode.cfg enables you to pause processing of data into a dataset, specify offline sources, or specify the frequency at which data workbench server saves its state files.

Making changes to the [!DNL Log Processing Mode.cfg] file, including adding or removing sources, does not cause reprocessing of the data.

**To edit the Log Processing Mode.cfg file for a dataset profile** 

1. While working in your dataset profile, open the [!DNL Profile Manager] and click **[!UICONTROL Dataset]** to show its contents.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If the [!DNL Log Processing Mode.cfg] file is not located in the directory for the desired profile, you need to copy this file from the Base directory on the data workbench server machine into the profile's directory.

   For information about opening and working with the [!DNL Profile Manager,] see the *Data Workbench User Guide*. 

1. Right-click the check mark next to the configuration file's name and click **[!UICONTROL Make Local]**. A check mark for this file appears in the [!DNL User] column.
1. Right-click the newly created check mark and click **[!UICONTROL Open]** > **[!UICONTROL from the workbench]**. The configuration window appears.
1. Edit the parameters in the configuration file using the following table as a guide.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Some of the parameters in the [!DNL Log Processing Mode.cfg] file have names that include [!DNL Fast Input] or [!DNL Fast Merge]. [!DNL Fast Input]refers to the log processing phase of dataset construction and is responsible for approximately half of the total dataset processing time. [!DNL Fast Merge] refers to the transformation phase of dataset construction only when preceded by log processing. [!DNL Fast Merge] does not occur during retransformation that results from modifying a [!DNL Transformation Dataset Configuration] file. Like [!DNL Fast Input], [!DNL Fast Merge] is also responsible for approximately half of the dataset processing time.
