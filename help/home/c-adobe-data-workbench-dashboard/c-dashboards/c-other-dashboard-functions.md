# Other Dashboard Functions{#other-dashboard-functions}

Special functions include sharing, exporting, and deleting dashboards and are performed from the details panel of a selected dashboard.

## Sharing a Dashboard Hyperlink {#section-16b592f157de404fb25bd2c739d2e2c1}

The **[!UICONTROL Share]** operation provides a URL that can be used to either bookmark the dashboard or mail a link for another user to access the dashboard. A Dashboard Link window will appear that provides you with the information needed to share the link to the desired dashboard.
