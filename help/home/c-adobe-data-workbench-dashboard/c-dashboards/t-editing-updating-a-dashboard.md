# Editing or Updating a Dashboard{#editing-or-updating-a-dashboard}

Existing dashboards can be edited at any time, either for temporary ad hoc purposes or to make permanent changes to be saved to the server.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only regular users and administrators can edit dashboards. Only the original dashboard creator or an administrator can save changes to the original copy of a dashboard. Otherwise, the only way to edit and save an existing dashboard is to save it as a copy. For more information on saving dashboards, see [Saving a Dashboard](../../../home/c-adobe-data-workbench-dashboard/c-dashboards/t-saving-a-dashboard.md#task-4132cf487bc640149c91afd0b7b0701e).

Any changes made to a dashboard will not be changed on the server unless they are saved. To make changes to a dashboard’s visualizations, please refer to the chapter on [visualizations](../../../home/c-adobe-data-workbench-dashboard/c-visualizations/c-visualizations.md#concept-426ed20f270f4be48ecc3574f3078d8e), which contains information on adding, configuring, and manipulating visualizations.
