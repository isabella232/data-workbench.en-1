# Opening and Viewing Dashboards{#opening-and-viewing-dashboards}

Dashboards can be opened in one of three ways: through the quick-access menu, through the Dashboard Browser, or by using a dashboard hyperlink. Though dashboards can only be opened one at a time in the dashboards interface, you may create a separate browser tab or window to view multiple dashboards at the same time.
