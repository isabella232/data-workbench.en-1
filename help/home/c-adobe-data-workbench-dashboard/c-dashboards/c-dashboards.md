# Dashboards{#dashboards}

Dashboards are created to visualize metrics and provide interactive analytic capability with data. By clicking on items within a dashboard, you can quickly and easily segment the data to derive information from your analysis. An unlimited number of dashboards can be created, either for short-term on-the-fly analysis or for long-term dashboard capability. Dashboards can be kept private or easily shared with other dashboard users. You can also export data from any dashboard for use in other tools such as Microsoft® Excel™.
