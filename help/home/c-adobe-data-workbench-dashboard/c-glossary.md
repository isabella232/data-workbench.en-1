# Glossary{#glossary}

The most commonly used terminology and features of Adobe data workbench, including the dashboard.

## Profiles {#section-9b34a2c00ef54008927394a396fc33a5}

Profiles define a dataset. A profile includes data about a particular subject, as well as the breakdown of that data into user-friendly analytic components. Profiles are created and managed within Adobe data workbench and made accessible through the dashboard application. Profiles are typically designed to fulfill a specific purpose (such as analyzing marketing and website traffic) and define a set of analytic components known as Dimensions, Metrics, and Filters.

## Dimensions {#section-f126625e45524d59b8b5db47d4d1d0dd}

Dimensions are categories of like data types. For example, the Days of Week dimension is composed of the following data elements: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Specifically, dimensions detail what is being measured. In the dashboard, dimensions are defined within Adobe data workbench and made accessible through the dashboard application. Each dimension has a unique name within the dashboard interface.

## Metrics {#section-4a7778c8209640b6a54afd82096eceef}

Metrics are quantitative objects defined by a quantifiable expression. For example, Page Views per Session is derived from the expression from the count of Page Views divided by the count of Sessions. Metrics answer the question of “how many?” In the dashboard, metrics are defined within Adobe data workbench and made accessible through the dashboard application. Each metric has a unique name within the dashboard interface.

## Filters {#section-916c8df454c04a5f8b3e5da9e3af4870}

Filters allow you to segment your data in a specific way. Filters will reduce your data to a subset of the whole result, and are often combined to provide a unique perspective on the data. In the dashboard, filters are first defined within Adobe data workbench and made accessible through the dashboard application. Each filter has a unique name within the dashboard interface.
