# Exporting Visualizations{#exporting-visualizations}

Exports data from the current visualization.

Data from visualizations can be quickly exported using the export icon at the top-right of the visualization window. Clicking this icon will initiate an export on the server and allow you to download the data in several formats. See [Exporting Data](../../../../home/c-adobe-data-workbench-dashboard/c-exporting-data.md#concept-826596f7c95649b2adbcafd91fad782b) for more information.
