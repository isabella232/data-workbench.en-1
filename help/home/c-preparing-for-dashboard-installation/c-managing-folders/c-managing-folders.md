# Managing Folders{#managing-folders}

All dashboards are saved into folders. The folder structure is entirely flexible and can be modified at any time. By default, only a single **[!UICONTROL Main]** folder exists at installation. This allows you to create a folder structure or dashboards specific to your organization.

Only administrators have the privilege to create and modify the folder structure. This is performed within the **[!UICONTROL Folder Manager]** and is accessible from the **[!UICONTROL Folder Manager]** tab in the **[!UICONTROL Administration Console]**.
