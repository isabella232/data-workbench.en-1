# Managing User Accounts{#managing-user-accounts}

User account management is performed using the User Manager section within the Administration Console.

Users can be created, edited, and deleted using the tools in this area. The number of users you can have at one time depends on how many users are licensed.

All user operations below are performed within the **[!UICONTROL User Manager]** tab in the **[!UICONTROL Administration Console]**.
