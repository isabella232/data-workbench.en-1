# Initializing the Dashboard{#initializing-the-dashboard}

The final step is to run the dashboard for the first time to allow it to initialize.

1. Open a web browser and enter the URL to the newly deployed site (for example, https://localhost/dashboard).
1. Connecting for the first time will setup the database tables, so you may experience a slight delay.
1. The initial logon credentials are:

   * **[!UICONTROL Username]**: admin
   * **[!UICONTROL Password]**: password

1. On your first login, go to **[!UICONTROL User]** > **[!UICONTROL Account Settings]** and select **[!UICONTROL Change Password]** to change your administrator password.

The dashboard installation is now complete. If you havenâ€™t already, use the instructions detailed in the Preparing Data Workbench section of this guide to configure your communication with data workbench servers and to manage users and groups.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Dashboard error and audit logs can be found in the [!DNL logs] directory within the installation path.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you need to change the application pool identity to a different account, make sure to grant access to the database and give the identity read/write access to the [!DNL logs] folder in the installation path.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you ever need to change the connection string for the database, simply edit the value using the **[!UICONTROL IIS Management Console]**.
