# Supported Browsers{#supported-browsers}

Lists all supported browsers.

The Adobe Insight dashboard is a web-based application that operates using the latest web browser technology. It can be used on any operating system given that the operating system is equipped with a compatible web browser.

Because the dashboard takes advantage of features not supported in older versions of web browsers, more recent browsers are required for an optimal experience when using the application. While many variations of browsers may work, only the following web browsers are officially supported:

* Google Chrome 15 and above (available at [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/)) 
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 and above (available at [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/)) 
* Mozilla Firefox 3.6 and above (available at [http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all-older.html](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all-older.html)) 
* Safari 5.1 and above (available at [http://www.apple.com/safari](http://www.apple.com/safari))

Aside from using a compatible web browser, no additional software needs to be downloaded in order to use the dashboard.
