# Data Workbench Implementation of Features{#data-workbench-implementation-of-features}

After setting up DWB, you can implement these features.

* To **Change visualizations for a new schema**, see [Analysis Visualizations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/data-workbench/using/client/analysis-visualizations/c-analysis-vis.html) and [Configuration Changes for New Schema](../../../home/dwb-implement-overview/dwb-implement-deliver/dwb-implement-config-new-schema.md#concept-9aced98e988b48ebbf9e6607c182d0de). 

* For **Derived Dimensions** in workspaces and visualizations, see the [Derived Dimensions Setup](../../../home/dwb-implement-overview/dwb-implement-deliver/dwb-implement-derived-dims.md#concept-19a5c554ac3e4bc9b86b9aaca5f8cad6). 

* For **Metric setup**, see the [Metrics setup](../../../home/dwb-implement-overview/dwb-implement-configure/dwb-implement-metric-setup.md#concept-f568a931db5b4b62b7b1e7827c7f7bf6) document. 

* To implement the **Globe visualization**, see [Globes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/data-workbench/using/client/analysis-visualizations/globes/c-globes.html).

* To implement **Workspaces for Attribution**, see [Rules-based Attribution](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/data-workbench/using/client/attribution-reports/c-rules-attrib.html?lang=en) and [Best Fit Attribution](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/data-workbench/using/client/attribution-reports/c-attrib-algorithmic.html?lang=en).

* To implement **Predictive Analytics** workspaces, see [Visualizations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/data-workbench/using/client/visualizations/c-vis.html) and the visualization listed below. 

* To implement **Predictive Intelligence with Clustering visualizations**, see [Clustering](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/data-workbench/using/client/analysis-visualizations/visitor-cluster/c-visitor-cluster.html?lang=en). 

* To implement **Predictive Intelligence with Propensity Scoring**, see [Propensity Scoring](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/data-workbench/using/client/analysis-visualizations/visitor-propensity/c-visitor-propensity.html). 

* To implement **Predictive Intelligence with a Lift/Gain Chart**, see [Lift/Gain Chart](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/data-workbench/using/client/analysis-visualizations/visitor-propensity/c-propensity-gain-lift-chart.html). 

* To implement **Predictive Intelligence with Decision Trees**, see [Decision Trees](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/data-workbench/using/client/analysis-visualizations/decision-trees/c-decision-trees.html). 

* To implement **Predictive Intelligence with Binomial Correlation**, see [Binomial Correlation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/data-workbench/using/client/analysis-visualizations/correlation-analysis/c-correlation-analysis.html). 

* To implement **Predictive Intelligence with Binomial Correlation**, see [Correlation Matrix](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/data-workbench/using/client/analysis-visualizations/correlation-analysis/c-correlation-analysis.html).

* To set up and validate the DWB Dashboard, go to the [Adobe Data Workbench Licensing Portal](https://license.visualsciences.com/License/#documentation). Also, see the [Basic Onboarding Instructions](../../../home/dwb-implement-overview/dwb-implement-provision/dwb-implement-onboarding.md#concept-e93aba41b26a410f959c5ca7f8e33355).
