# Analytics Reports{#analytics-reports}

Analytic reports are provided for users of the Adobe SC profile. These data workbench reports—Page Views, Traffic, Unique Visitors, Referring Domain and other significant report types—are standard reports in Adobe Analytics.

For Adobe Analytics' users, these templates allow users employing the Adobe SC profile (which uses the SC/Insight data feed) to view reports generated from Data Workbench using templates similar to the Adobe [Marketing Reports & Analytics](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/digital-analytics/marketing-reports-analytics.html?promoid=KAUCM) capability. Users can access these pre-configured reports using data workbench templates.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This menu will only appear for those users who have implemented the Adobe SC profile.

**To Open Reports**

On the worktop, right-click and select **[!UICONTROL New]** to view and open report templates.
