# Query language syntax{#query-language-syntax}

Query language syntax for creating and editing metric, dimension, and filter expressions.

[Syntax for Identifiers](../c-qry-lang-syntx/c-syntx-id.md): Metric, dimension, and filter expressions can use identifiers to refer to named metrics, dimensions, and filters.

[Syntax for Metric Expressions](../c-qry-lang-syntx/c-syntx-mtrc-exp.md): Metrics can be edited using the Metric Editor and saved in the Metrics directory of a profile.

[Syntax for Dimension Expressions](../c-qry-lang-syntx/c-syntx-dim-exp.md): Dimension expressions are never used alone, but can be used anywhere a dimension is called for in a metric or filter expression.

[Syntax for Filter Expressions](../c-qry-lang-syntx/c-syntx-fltr-exp.md): A filter is an expression that defines a subset of the data in a dataset.

[Syntax for Math Expressions](../c-qry-lang-syntx/c-math-expressions.md): Data workbench allows you to employ additional mathematical calculations.

[Statistical Callouts](../c-qry-lang-syntx/c-statistical-callouts.md): Select these operators to add to statistical callouts.

[Regular Expressions](../c-qry-lang-syntx/c-search-regex.md): Data workbench utilizes regular expressions (regex) for search and sort operations.
