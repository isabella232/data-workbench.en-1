# Statistical Callouts{#statistical-callouts}

Statistical callouts measure meaningful relationships to identify hidden opportunities and variables of interest for more advanced data mining capabilities in audience clustering and visitor response scoring.

Statistical callouts expand the algorithms so that more types of data can be correlated, such as binomial variables (yes/no, 0/1, or purchaser/non-purchaser) correlated with countable metrics (visits, orders, or downloads).

To add statistical callouts:

1. In a table, right-click the metric header. 
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Statistics]** and then select or clear the checkmarks for each required setting. All in the Display Callout are selected as the default setting.

The callout can return statistical values factored into the dataset columns.

   <td colname="col2"><p> A measure of the variance of the Metric values from the Metric mean for that dimension. It is equal to the square of the standard deviation. </p></td>
