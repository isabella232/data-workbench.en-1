>[!NOTE]

>Visualizations cannot be imported like workspaces. When you right-click in the worktop and select **[!UICONTROL Import]**, you can import an existing workspace but not a visualization residing outside of the workspace. If you attempt to import a visualization, you will receive a "not a valid workspace" error.
