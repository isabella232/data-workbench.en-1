# Create a workspace{#create-a-workspace}

You can customize existing workspaces by adding or modifying existing visualizations or creating new workspaces.

You can then save these workspaces for later use. See [Creating Workspaces](../../../home/c-get-started/c-work-worksp/c-create-worksp.md#concept-d8bc99d7739e4eaeab2a02b022394a31).

You can create new workspaces by creating a blank workspace, copying and pasting an existing workspace, or saving a workspace to another location or using another name.

This section describes the following tasks:

* [Adding New Workspaces](../../../home/c-get-started/c-work-worksp/c-create-worksp.md#section-4236ae30e2884ea08f0885bf329f0778) 
* [Copying and Pasting Existing Workspaces](../../../home/c-get-started/c-work-worksp/c-create-worksp.md#section-f91ae89b845640c9a4a52820a6110e65) 
* [Changing a Workspace Name](../../../home/c-get-started/c-work-worksp/c-create-worksp.md#section-ca7edb913e4e4630a856f45a2536ffad)

## Adding New Workspaces {#section-4236ae30e2884ea08f0885bf329f0778}

On the desired [!DNL Worktop] tab, right-click a blank area within the tab and click one of the following options:

* **[!UICONTROL New]** > **[!UICONTROL Blank Workspace]**. This option displays a standard size, blank workspace. 

* **[!UICONTROL New]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Template]**. This option displays a standard size template that you can use to create reports.

## Copying and Pasting Existing Workspaces {#section-f91ae89b845640c9a4a52820a6110e65}

You can copy and paste an existing workspace onto to any other workspace. If you paste the workspace on a tab that contains a server version of a workspace with the same name, the workspace is pasted as a local version of that workspace. If you paste the workspace on a tab that contains server and local versions of a workspace with the same name, the workspace is pasted as a user version of that workspace with the same name followed by (Copy). If you paste the workspace on a tab that does not contain a workspace with the same name, the workspace is pasted as a new user workspace.

**To copy and paste an existing workspace**

1. On the desired [!DNL Worktop] tab, right-click the workspace that you want to copy and click **[!UICONTROL Copy]**.

   The following example is a workspace pasted on a workspace tab that contains a server version:

The following example is a workspace pasted on a workspace tab that already contains a server and local version. The workspace is pasted as a user version of that workspace with the same name followed by (Copy):
