# Customize the profile manager and server file manager{#customize-the-profile-manager-and-server-file-manager}

The Profile Manager and Server Files Manager display a large number of directories and files.

 In some cases, you may want to access a subdirectory of one of these managers without having to navigate its entire directory structure. To do so, you can create a new manager that displays only those directories that you select.
