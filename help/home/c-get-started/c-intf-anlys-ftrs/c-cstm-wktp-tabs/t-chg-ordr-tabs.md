Steps to change the order of the tabs that appear in the Worktop.

1. In the [!DNL Profile Manager], click **[!UICONTROL Workspaces]** to view its contents.
1. In the *working profile name* column, right-click the check mark for the [!DNL Workspaces\order.txt] file and click **[!UICONTROL Make Local]** > **[!UICONTROL Yes]**.
1. Right-click the check mark for the [!DNL Workspaces\order.txt] file in the [!DNL User] column and click **[!UICONTROL Open]** > **[!UICONTROL in Notepad]**.
1. Rename, delete, or add tab names exactly as you want them to appear in the [!DNL Worktop]. For example, the following would result in the [!DNL Getting Started] tab appearing first and the [!DNL Acquisition] tab appearing last.
