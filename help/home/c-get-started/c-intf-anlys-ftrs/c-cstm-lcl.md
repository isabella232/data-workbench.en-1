# Customize Data Workbench locally{#customize-data-workbench-locally}

Data Workbench is extremely flexible in the number of ways it can be customized.

All customizations made by a user to their instance of Data Workbench reside in the User folder within the Data Workbench installation directory. This directory is synchronized with the Data Workbench server to provide a backup of your local information.

To remove any customizations to Data Workbench, delete all files and folders within the Data Workbench installation directory except the five elements installed originally:

* Base folder 
* Certificates folder 
* Configuration folder 
* [!DNL Insight.cfg] file 
* [!DNL Insight.exe] file
