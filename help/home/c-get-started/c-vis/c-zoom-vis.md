# Zoom in or out in a visualization{#zoom-in-or-out-in-a-visualization}

You can zoom in or out on data in graphs, globes, process maps, and scatter plots.

## Zooming on objects in process maps and globes {#section-be293f50337f49ee8f0f1ee3e613e4a1}

**To zoom in on an area**

* Point to the desired area, press and hold both mouse buttons, then move the mouse forward (away from you).

**To zoom out on an area**

* Point to the desired area, press and hold both mouse buttons, then move the mouse backward (toward you).

## Zooming on axes in graphs and scatter plots {#section-1438a5d637e84d68b69e269062dd3d7a}

Both graphs and scatter plots have axes that you can zoom in or out on separately (that is, you can zoom in on one axis, then zoom out on the other).

>[!NOTE]
>
>For the y-axis in a line graph and the x- or y-axis in a scatter plot, the zoom resets every time the underlying data changes. Because this happens quite often when working online, Adobe recommends that you work offline when you need to zoom these axes. See [Working Offline and Online](../../../home/c-get-started/c-off-on.md#concept-cef8758ede044b18b3558376c5eb9f54).

**To zoom in on the x- or y-axis of a graph** When you zoom vertically (along the y-axis), the x-axis remains fixed and the data stretches upward.

1. Place your mouse pointer on the x- or y-axis metric or dimension label area of the graph. 
1. Press both mouse buttons and move the mouse forward (away from you). Arrows appear on the axis indicating that more data is available beyond the portion of the visualization currently displayed.

**To zoom out on the x- or y-axis of a graph**

1. Place your mouse pointer on the x- or y-axis metric or dimension label area of the graph. 
1. Press both mouse buttons and move the mouse backward (toward you).

**To zoom in on all data on the x- or y-axis of a graph** The [!DNL Zoom to All] menu command returns to a display of all of the data on the selected axis.

* Right-click the x- or y-axis border areas (near the data labels) and click **[!UICONTROL Zoom to All]**.

**To zoom in on data selected in graphs**

1. Click and drag the mouse pointer across the range of data you want to select. 
1. Right-click in the dimension label area and click **[!UICONTROL Zoom to Selection]**.
