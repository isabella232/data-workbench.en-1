# Zoom to View Visualizations{#zoom-to-view-visualizations}

Use the Zoom feature to see metric labels in a visualization with a high disparity of values.

Use the zoom feature to better view metric labels when values reach a higher disparity. For example, when you set a higher metric regression value against previous values. Previously the label would disappear with the change in the contrast of values. You can now zoom in to the visualization by clicking **`<Ctrl>`** and moving the mouse wheel while hovering over the graph.
