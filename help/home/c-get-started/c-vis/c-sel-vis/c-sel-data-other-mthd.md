# Selecting Data Using Other Methods{#selecting-data-using-other-methods}

In addition to making simple yet powerful point-and-click selections in visualizations, your Adobe application provides three methods that you can use to select data and work with that selected data.

Each of these methods is appropriate for particular situations:

* **Segments:** Segments enable you to build dimensions on-the-fly from your selections. Segments are most useful when working with disjointed, non-overlapping groups that you want to use as a dimension.

  Example: You want to compare two types of shoppers based on their previous purchases: Window Shoppers versus Paying Customers.

  Using a segment affects only the workspace in which you are using the segment dimension. See [Segments](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-analysis-vis/c-seg/c-seg.md#concept-71a333e5c7334e0489c76fca95862fbc). 

* **Filters:** The filter editor enables you to make complex data selections and see the selection criteria clearly specified in the editor. You also can save any filter to use again.

  Example: You want to analyze the data related to customers from California who placed more than five orders in one month.

  Using a filter affects only the workspace in which you have applied the filter. See [Filter Editors](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-analysis-vis/c-filter-editors/c-filter-editors.md#concept-2f343ecbed8240f18b0c1f1eccef11e3). 

* **Subsets:** Subsets enable you to identify and work with smaller subsets of your data. Subsets give you a smaller dataset to analyze, which provides you with faster query results. When using a subset, all of your benchmarks relate to your subset, not to the entire dataset, which is much more useful when analyzing a specific subset.

  Example: You want to perform an in-depth analysis of the data related to only those customers from California.

  Using a subset affects all of your workspaces because the subset is applied globally to Data Workbench. See [Working with Subsets](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-vis/c-wk-subsets/c-wk-subsets.md#concept-43809322b6374d5cb2536630a13e943b).
