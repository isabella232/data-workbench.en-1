1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Filter]**.

       After you save the filter, you can load it to use in other workspaces. See below how to load an existing filter or reference it by name in a [!DNL Metric Editor]. See [Creating and Editing Derived Metrics](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-admin-intrf/c-prof-mgr/c-drvd-mtrcs.md#concept-e41723b342a849309874b26232224a40).

       >[!NOTE]
