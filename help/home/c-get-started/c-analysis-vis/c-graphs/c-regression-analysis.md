# Regression Analysis Graph{#regression-analysis-graph}

The Bar Graph in Data Workbench now includes a regression comparison for multiple metrics across multiple graphs.

[Bar graphs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/data-workbench/using/client/analysis-visualizations/graphs/c-graphs.html) in Data Workbench let you regress metrics in one graph to metrics in another graph. If you have multiple graphs, you can compare a metric (as the independent variable) to a graph evaluating other metrics (as dependent variables). This lets you determine the strength of the relationship between one dependent variable (the metric established first) and a series of other changing metrics (regressions with the established dependent metric).

The regression analysis on a graph visualization allows analysts to perform "what-if" scenarios. For example, if visits increase to this level, what impact will this increase have on revenue?

**Setting up Regression Analysis**

1. Select graph as a dependent metric for a regression comparison.

   Right-click on the graph and select **Set as base metric for regression**.

1. Set other metric graphs as independent variables.

   Right-click metric and select **[!UICONTROL Regress with `<base metric name>`]** for other metrics.

1. View regression by right-clicking on the graph to move the bar up and down.

   If you right-click on the graph for a specific value, you can then see the regression ratios for each metric based for upward or downward values.

   For example, if my Page Views decrease to 86,041, then the other metrics will have these values: Visits at 12,183 and Visitors by Visit at 12,028.

   If Visitors by Visits values increase to 26,141, then the other metrics will be Visits at 26,560 and Page Views will be at 189,091.
