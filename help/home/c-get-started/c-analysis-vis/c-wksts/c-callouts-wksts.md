# Use callouts with worksheets{#use-callouts-with-worksheets}

To make the information in a worksheet more clear, you can add a callout to bring attention to a particular metric.

 By default, Data Workbench provides the following types of metric callouts:

* Annotation 
* Blank Bars 
* Blank Line Graph 
* Blank Scatter Plot

To add a new visualization to your workspace that includes a metric that you calculated in your worksheet, you add a metric callout as a bar graph, line graph, or scatter plot callout. Metric callouts function as selections and, therefore, affect any other visualizations within the workspace.

You can change the default dimensions for metric callouts as well as add new types of callouts by configuring the callout files stored in the *profile name*\Context\Metric Callout folder of the [!DNL Server] installation folder. See [Configuring Callouts](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-intf-anlys-ftrs/c-config-callouts.md#concept-f6e91e172f5e4c009245c9c549beb76a).
