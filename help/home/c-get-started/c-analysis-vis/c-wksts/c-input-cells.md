How to create an input cell.

When cell B1 is formatted as an input cell (by right-clicking the cell and clicking **[!UICONTROL Format]** > **[!UICONTROL Input Cell]**) and you lock the visualization (by right-clicking its top border and clicking **[!UICONTROL Locked]**), you can change the value of the input cell to view results “on-the-fly.”
