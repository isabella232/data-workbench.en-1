Data Workbench provides worksheets for creating ad hoc filters and metrics for the current visualization.

 A worksheet is similar to an ordinary spreadsheet, but unlike a spreadsheet, every cell containing a formula can define a metric.

Unlike metrics created using the [!DNL Metric Editor], metrics defined using worksheets do not appear in the metric menus, but can be saved and included in any of your workspaces.

For information about the [!DNL Metric Editor], see [Creating and Editing Derived Metrics](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-admin-intrf/c-prof-mgr/c-drvd-mtrcs.md#concept-e41723b342a849309874b26232224a40).
