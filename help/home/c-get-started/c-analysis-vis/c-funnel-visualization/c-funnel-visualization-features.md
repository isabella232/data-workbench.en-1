# Funnel Features{#funnel-features}

The Funnel visualization includes features to build a funnel with multiple dimensions, raw visitor numbers, percentage of visitors at each step, and separate scopes.

Here are the basic features of the funnel visualization.

## Funnel Steps {#section-96a6732558dd4740b73541844f06d3ef}

The disks in a funnel represent the steps in the navigation, the cones represent the fall-through from one step to the next, and the arrows represent the fallout. Clicking a cone will select the users who fell through at that point and include them in the current workspace filter. Clicking an arrow will select the visitors who fell out.

>[!NOTE]

>The Funnel visualization has a limit of eight steps that can be applied.

## Additional Funnel Features and Functionality {#section-22a3582db8114ca8bce77f50bbbf296a}

* **Adjust the clip and level of the funnel**. Select the Funnel option from the Visualization menu. After the funnel is created, you can right-click on the title to adjust the clip and level to any countable metric in your system.

* **Drag more elements**. Add more elements to your funnel by dragging and dropping them from the Dimension table to the funnel using the `<Ctrl>` + `<Alt>` keys. You can drag multiple steps at the same time from the Dimension table by selecting multiple items (using `<Ctrl>` + click) and then dragging them to the Funnel visualization using the `<Ctrl>` + `<Alt>` keys.. 
* **Delete a step**: Delete elements by right-clicking on the step in the visualization and clicking **Yes**.

* **Rearrange the steps you have dragged to the funnel**. Simply click the step to select it and drag it to another position to rearrange the steps. 
* **Open a Path Browser**. You can see more detail about where customers fall through or fall out of the process through the [Add a Path Browser](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-analysis-vis/c-funnel-visualization/c-path-browser-funnel.md#concept-b0cedf7a28ae422696ded1258c9a4119) feature. 

* **Add more steps**. You can add a maximum of eight steps to each funnel visualization. 
* **Change the metric**. The metric can be changed so the steps are counting visits or some other metric at each step. Available options vary by dataset. 
* **Display in a tabular view**. Right-click the title to display the Funnel Visualization menu and click **[!UICONTROL Show Tabular View]**. Once in tabular view, you can select **[!UICONTROL Show Graph View]** to return to graphic representation of the funnel. To open the Tabular View, right-click on the title and select Show Tabular View from the menu. 

* **Compare sequences**. An efficient way to compare two similar sequences is to display their two visualizations side-by-side. You can also display both the tabular view and the graph view side-by-side using the Duplicate feature. To open, right-click on the title and select Duplicate from the menu.
