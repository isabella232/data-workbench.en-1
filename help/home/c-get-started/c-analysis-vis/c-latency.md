# Latency Analysis{#latency-analysis}

The Latency visualization lets you analyze latent customer behavior within a set number of days before or after an event occurred after a campaign or other type of event or period of time.

The **[!UICONTROL Latency]** visualization allows you to set a metric to identify behavior before, during, or after an event occurred to determine its effect on customer behavior. For example, you can identify the effectiveness of a marketing campaign by viewing the revenue a week after an event occurred. Or you can show customer behavior a week previous to the event as a baseline to see an event's effect on behavior.

Using the Latency visualization, you can change the Time dimension from day, hour, week, or other time period, to visit, click through, hit, or other countable dimension.

**Setting up Latency Analysis**
