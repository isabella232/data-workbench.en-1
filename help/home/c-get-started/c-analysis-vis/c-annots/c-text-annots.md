# Text annotations{#text-annotations}

Text annotations are windows into which you can enter arbitrary text to add descriptive information or comments to a workspace.

You move or manipulate text annotations within a workspace in the same manner as other types of visualizations. You also can format the appearance of the text as well as name, edit, or save any text annotation that you add to a workspace. Text annotations also can be exported to Microsoft Excel and generated and distributed by [!DNL Report].

For more information about [!DNL Reports], see the *Insight Report Guide*.
