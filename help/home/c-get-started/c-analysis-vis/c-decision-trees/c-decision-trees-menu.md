     </ul> </p> <p>Tip:  These numbers are obtained by applying the resulted scoring model of the 20 percent testing data withheld and already known as the true answer. If the score is greater than 50 percent, it is predicted as a positive case (that matches the defined filter). Then, Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + FP + TN + FN), Recall = TP / (TP + FN), and Precision = TP / (TP + FP). </p> </td>
