# Decision Tree Builder{#decision-tree-builder}

Decision trees are a predictive analytics visualization used to evaluate visitor characteristics and relationships. The Decision Tree Builder generates a decision tree visualization based on a specified positive case and a set of inputs.

A Decision Tree is a binary classifier with a set of rules (or filters) identifying visitors who satisfy specific rules based on a positive case. A decision tree sets rules to classify visitors who satisfy (or do not satisfy) this positive case. These rules generate a tree map to provide a level of confidence to meet these positive case results.

A Decision Tree is built by examining inputs at each level and choosing the one that provides a maximum gain of information at a specified split point. Split points for each variable-level generates two sets:

* Values less than or equal to the split point, and 
* Values greater than the split point.

Use decision trees to

* Perform meaningful analysis and interpretation in less time. 
* Employ automated segment generation. 
* Quickly make inferences from a model based on a large amount of data.

   <td colname="col2"> <p><b>Input Listing</b> </p> <p>This area displays the inputs into the tree model. They are color coded to match nodes in the Tree Display area. </p> <p>Right-clicking on an input allows you to remove the input from the model and reset. </p> <p>If you hover over a tree node, it will display the split conditions along the branch to that node and the prediction at that node with its confidence value. </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col3"> <p><b>Tree Display</b> </p> <p>This area displays the tree model with leaf nodes color-coded based on its prediction: green for a True prediction of the Positive Case, and red for a False prediction. </p> <p>The split nodes are color coded to the inputs that match their selection condition. Hovering over a node displays information about the split and expands the inputs listing to display the split points along the branch and the distribution of the training set. </p> <p>Nodes below a threshold are not displayed by default. Click on an expandable node (indicated by a + symbol) to explore a branch. Click on the root node to return to the full tree display. </p> </td>
