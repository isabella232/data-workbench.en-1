# Fit data to a window{#fit-data-to-a-window}

The Fit to Window option allows the data columns in a table to automatically expand or shrink to fit the window each time you resize it.

 When [!DNL Fit to Window] is disabled, the data columns must be sized manually.

**To enable or disable the fit to window option**

* Right-click the top border of the visualization and click **[!UICONTROL Fit to Window]**.

* Click the line dividing any two data columns (in the top-axis region) and drag to the desired width.
