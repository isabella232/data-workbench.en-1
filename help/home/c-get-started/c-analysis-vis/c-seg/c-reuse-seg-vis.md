# Reusing a segment visualization{#reusing-a-segment-visualization}

If you want to use the same segment information again, you can save the segment visualization, the workspace containing the segment visualization, or save the segments themselves as a dimension.

If you would like all users of a profile to use the segments and dimensions that you create or modify, a user with the appropriate permissions must upload them to the appropriate profile using the [!DNL Profile Manager]. See [Publishing Files to Your Working Profile](../../../../home/c-get-started/c-admin-intrf/c-prof-mgr/t-pub-files-wkg-prof.md#task-a0106e010c834d16bd60eef4721b6af9).

**To save the segment visualization for use in other workspaces**

1. Right-click the top border of the segment visualization and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**. The [!DNL Save] window appears. The default save location is the User\*profile name*\Work folder. 
1. In the [!DNL File name] field, type a more descriptive name for the visualization and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

**To retrieve the saved segment visualization**

1. Right-click within the workspace and click **[!UICONTROL Open]** > **[!UICONTROL File]**. The [!DNL Open Visualization] window appears. 
1. Navigate to the segment visualization that you saved in the User\*profile name*\Work folder. 
1. Select the segment visualization file ( [!DNL *.vw]) and click **[!UICONTROL Open]**.
