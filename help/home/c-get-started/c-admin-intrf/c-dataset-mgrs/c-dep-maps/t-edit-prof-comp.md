# Edit profile components{#edit-profile-components}

Steps to edit the configuration of a profile component.

From a dependency map, you can open the configuration or editor window for a log source, transformation, extended dimension, derived dimension, or metric. 

1. Right-click the desired node and click one of the following options:

    * **[!UICONTROL Edit Configuration]**. Available for log sources, transformations, extended dimensions, and derived dimensions. The callout that appears contains only the configuration information for the component. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Edit Whole Configuration File]**. Available for log sources, transformations, and extended dimensions. The callout that appears contains the entire configuration file in which the component is defined. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Edit Formula]**. Available for metrics. The callout that appears contains a metric editor window. For information about the [!DNL metric editor], see [Creating and Editing Derived Metrics](../../../../../home/c-get-started/c-admin-intrf/c-prof-mgr/c-drvd-mtrcs.md#concept-e41723b342a849309874b26232224a40).

1. Edit the parameters as desired.

   For more information about the parameters for dataset components, see the *Dataset Configuration Guide*. 

1. To save the file locally, right-click **[!UICONTROL (modified)]** or **[!UICONTROL (New)]** at the top of the window and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
To make the changes take effect, save the file to the server using the [!DNL Profile Manager]. See [Publishing Files to Your Working Profile](../../../../../home/c-get-started/c-admin-intrf/c-prof-mgr/t-pub-files-wkg-prof.md#task-a0106e010c834d16bd60eef4721b6af9).
