# Publish files to your working profile{#publish-files-to-your-working-profile}

The Profile Manager enables the management of visualizations, segments, metrics, dimensions, and so on.

 For example, if you create a metric that is useful to other users, you can share this metric with other Data Workbench users working with this profile by publishing (or uploading) it to the Data Workbench server.

Although you can save workspaces to your working profile on the Data Workbench server using the [!DNL Profile Manager], you can do so directly from the [!DNL Worktop] by right-clicking a workspace thumbnail and selecting **[!UICONTROL Save to server]**, which is the suggested method.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only users with the appropriate permissions can save workspaces to the Data Workbench server. For more information, contact your system administrator.

**To publish a saved file** 

1. In the [!DNL Profile Manager], open the necessary folders and subfolders in the [!DNL Profile Manager] to locate the file that you want to publish. The [!DNL Profile Manager] displays a white check mark in the [!DNL User] column next to the file indicating that a local copy of this file now resides in the User\*profile name* folder on your computer.
1. Right-click the white check mark for the file in the [!DNL User] column and click **[!UICONTROL Save to]** > *< **[!UICONTROL profile name]**>*.

   The [!DNL Profile Manager] displays a check mark next to the file name in the selected profile’s column and removes the white check mark in the [!DNL User] column. Your file is now available for use by all users and is downloaded automatically to them (and you) when the profile is next loaded.
