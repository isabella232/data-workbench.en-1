# Master Marketing Profile Export{#master-marketing-profile-export}

Data Workbench lets you export files to integrate with Profiles and Audiences as part of an integrated Adobe Experience Cloud.

<!-- <a id="section_731922BC8628479198A41EF3EA72F2FF"></a> -->

Profiles and Audiences is part of the [Experience Cloud Identity Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/home.html), a core service of the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud]. The Profiles and Audiences export allows audiences to be shared across the Experience Cloud using a unique Experience Cloud ID (ECID) that is assigned to every visitor and then used by [Audience Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/aam-home.html). The [!DNL ExportIntegration.exe] application ( [!DNL E:\Server\Scripts]) is employed to generate both MMP and Adobe Target exports.

**Configuring the FSU Server to use Profiles and Audiences**

1. Access your FSU server. 
1. Open the MMPExport.cfg file. `Server/Admin/Export/MMPExport.cfg`. 
1. Enter values in the all fields as required. For example: 

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >MMP/AAM integration relies on Amazon's s3 bucket for data transfer. 
   >
   >
   >The s3 information required for MMP (s3) transfer can be obtained from Audience Manager team.

   ```
   Sample MMPExport.cfg
   MMP Export Configuration = MMPExportConfiguration: 
   s3 Bucket = string: aws_bucket_for_mmp 
   s3 Object Directory = string: test/files/ 
   s3 Region = string: us-east-1 
   s3 Access Key = string: ZZKI62OO5YBA 
   s3 Secret Key = string: ioqwa3OpNE5 
   data Provider Name = string: 895 
   client ID = string: mcprofile2-test 
   client Secret = string: saea1287617212987q 
   username = string: mmptest 
   password = string: pass 
   numRecordsPerChunk = int:  
   numThreads = int:  
   maxRetriesOnSendFailure = unsigned int:
   ```

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The [!DNL MMPExport.cfg]file also lets you take all records, split them into sets, and create chunks of records. The chunks of records are then exported to Amazon S3. Three mandatory parameters are required to create chunks of records: [!DNL numRecordsPerChunk], [!DNL numThreads], and [!DNL maxRetriesOnSendFailure].

**Generating MMP export from the client**

1. From the client, open a workspace and right-click **[!UICONTROL Tools]**> **[!UICONTROL Detail Table]**. 
1. Add **Level**. 
1. Right-click the header and select **Add Attributes**. 
1. Right-click the header and select **New Master Marketing Profile Export**. ![](assets/mmp_mmp_export.png)
1. Expand **Query**. 

   ![](assets/mmp_mmp_query.png)

1. Expand **MMP Configuration**. 
1. (required) Enter the **MMP Segment Name** and **MMP Visitor ID Field**. These parameters cannot be left empty. 
1. The **MMP Segment Name** should match the Segment ID defined in the MMP. 
1. The **MMP Visitor ID** is the attribute column defined in step 4 that corresponds to the **Visitor ID**. 
1. Once these fields are entered, you can save the export by right-clicking the header for the export and choose **Save** as "User\.export". 
1. Open **Admin** > **Profile Manager** and save the export to the profile.

   If all data is entered correctly, this will generate an export file in the FSU ([!DNL Server/Exports]) and it will also transfer the export to the AWS using the information in [!DNL MMPExport.cfg]. The log for this is provided in [!DNL Server/Trace/]. eg., [!DNL MMP-102014-133651- `<Segment Export Name>` .log]
