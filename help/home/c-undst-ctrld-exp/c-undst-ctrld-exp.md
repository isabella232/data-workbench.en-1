# Data Workbench Controlled Experiments{#data-workbench-controlled-experiments}

Controlled experiments are tests that enable you to compare results obtained from an experimental sample group with those from a standard control group.

Site enables you to implement, measure, and analyze controlled experiments and their results as they relate to different aspects of your website. Doing so enables you to test hypotheses regarding the improvement of website performance before spending significant time or money fully implementing the proposed changes.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Site experiments can be analyzed only in datasets where the only method of visitor identification in use is the [!DNL Sensor] set persistent cookie method. Sensors running on J2EE servers (JBoss, Tomcat, WebLogic, and WebSphere) do not support controlled experimentation. For more information, see the following section.

Using Site, you can implement A/B, A/B/A, and multivariate controlled experiments to gather enough test data to provide statistically accurate data for a detailed evaluation of your hypothesis, without impacting current website performance.
