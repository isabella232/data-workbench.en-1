Instructions to complete your installation of the repeater functionality.

* On the servers from which you want to collect data, install [!DNL Sensors] as described in the * [!DNL Insight] Sensor Guide* and have them transmit data to the repeater server. 

* If you have not set up the [!DNL Replication Service] for [!DNL Insight Server], see [Insight Server Replication Service](../../../../home/c-inst-svr/c-ins-svr-rep-svc/c-ins-svr-rep-svc.md#concept-926e654e80d943a0b6ac44a82a510d92) for instructions to install the service on an [!DNL Insight Server] FSU.
