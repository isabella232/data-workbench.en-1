# Configuring the Replication Service{#configuring-the-replication-service}

You must configure the target Insight Server(s) to retrieve data from the Repeater on which the original event data is stored.

To configure the retrieval of data from a [!DNL Repeater] to a target [!DNL Insight Server], you must edit the [!DNL Replicate.cfg] file provided in the [!DNL Components] folder on the target [!DNL Insight Server(s)] as described in the following procedure:

**To configure the [!DNL Replication Service] on the target machine** 

1. In [!DNL Insight], on the [!DNL Admin] > [!DNL Dataset and Profile] tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Servers Manager]** thumbnail to open the Servers Manager workspace.
1. Right-click the icon of the target [!DNL Insight Server] you want to configure and click **[!UICONTROL Server Files]**.
1. In the [!DNL Server Files Manager], click **[!UICONTROL Components]** to view its contents. The [!DNL Replicate.cfg] file is located within this directory.
1. Right-click the check mark in the *server name* column for [!DNL Replicate.cfg] and click **[!UICONTROL Make Local]**. A check mark appears in the [!DNL Temp] column for [!DNL Replicate.cfg].
1. Right-click the newly created check mark in the [!DNL Temp] column and click **[!UICONTROL Open]** > **[!UICONTROL in Insight]**. The [!DNL Replicate.cfg] window opens.
1. In the [!DNL Replicate.cfg] window, click **[!UICONTROL Replicate.cfg]**, then **[!UICONTROL component]** to view its contents.
1. Edit the parameters using the following example and table as guides:

1. Save your changes to the server by doing the following:

    1. Right-click **[!UICONTROL (modified)]** at the top of the window and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**. 
    1. In the [!DNL Server Files Manager], right-click the check mark for the file in the [!DNL Temp] column and select **[!UICONTROL Save to]** > *< **[!UICONTROL server name]**>*.

This example illustrates how files are copied if both the Flatten Paths and Recursive parameters are set to true.

Suppose Remote URI is [!DNL /RemoteRoot/] and Local Path is [!DNL E:\LocalRoot\]. On the remote ( [!DNL Repeater]) machine, the files are organized as follows:

* [!DNL /RemoteRoot/fileA.txt]
* [!DNL /RemoteRoot/Dir1/fileB.txt]
* [!DNL /RemoteRoot/Dir2/Subdir3/fileC.txt]

When replication is complete, the local directory has the following files:

* [!DNL E:\LocalRoot\fileA.txt] 
* [!DNL E:\LocalRoot\fileB.txt] 
* [!DNL E:\LocalRoot\fileC.txt]

In the local directory, no subdirectories are created, and all files from the remote directory tree are placed in the top level of the local directory.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If files in the various subdirectories on the remote machine share the same name(s), the [!DNL Replication Service] may stop or other undefined behavior may occur.
