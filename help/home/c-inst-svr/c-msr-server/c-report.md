# Report Server Requirements{#report-server-requirements}

Data workbench report server is the component that allows the output of scheduled reporting.

 The reports that are output can either be in the form of .PNG images or .XLS spreadsheets placed in a file system, or as emails. Its hardware requirements are identical to the [ [!DNL data workbench client]](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/insight/install/index.html#Data_Workbench_Client_Minimum_System_Requirements).

The following requirements exist for [!DNL report server]:

* Access to file system for output of data (network share, or local drive). 
* Access to configured SMTP server. 
* Microsoft Excel 2003 or above installed on [!DNL report] server. See [Considerations for server-side Automation of Office](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257757) for additional information.
