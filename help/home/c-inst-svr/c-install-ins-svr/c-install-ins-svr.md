# Installing Data Workbench Servers{#installing-data-workbench-servers}

Insight Server is licensed per server computer.

 In many implementations of Adobe applications, only one installation of [!DNL Insight Server] is required; however, additional [!DNL Insight Servers] may be added to the first to make an [!DNL Insight Server] cluster.

This section describes how to install a single [!DNL Insight Server] Data Processing Unit (DPU) or File Server Unit (FSU). For steps to install and configure an [!DNL Insight Server] cluster, see [Insight Server Clusters](../../../home/c-inst-svr/c-install-ins-svr/c-ins-svr-clstrs/c-abt-ins-svr-clsters.md).
