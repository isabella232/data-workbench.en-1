# Adding Insight Servers to an Existing Cluster{#adding-insight-servers-to-an-existing-cluster}

In some cases, you may find it necessary to add an Insight Server machine to an existing Insight Server cluster.

 When you add an [!DNL Insight Server] DPU or [!DNL Insight Server] FSU to a cluster, you must update the configuration files on the master [!DNL Insight Server] to include the address information for the new machine(s) and set up the new DPU or FSU.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The procedures described in this section require [!DNL Insight]. If you have not installed [!DNL Insight], follow the instructions in the * [!DNL Insight] User Guide* before proceeding.
