# Next Steps{#next-steps}

After you have set up Transform, you must configure it to export log source data for use by other applications.

To configure [!DNL Transform], you edit the [!DNL [!DNL Insight] Transform.cfg] and [!DNL [!DNL Insight] Transform Mode.cfg] files within the [!DNL Dataset] folder for the profile for which you want to export event data. For configuration instructions, see the [!DNL Transform] chapter of the *Dataset Configuration Guide*.

After you have configured [!DNL Transform] to export event data for your profile, you can view memory usage information in the Detailed Status interface. For more information, see the Administrative Interfaces chapter of the * [!DNL Insight] User Guide*.
