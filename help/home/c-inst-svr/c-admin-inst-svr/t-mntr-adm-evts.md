# Monitoring Administrative Events{#monitoring-administrative-events}

You should regularly monitor your event log files to track Insight Server system event messages, which are logged to the `<YYYYMMDD>-event.txt` files located by default in the Events folder within the Insight Server installation directory.

 **Recommended Frequency:** Every 5-10 minutes

You can monitor these events using the [!DNL Server Files Manager] in [!DNL Insight], your automated management tool, the [!DNL *-event.txt] files, or the Windows Event Viewer.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Administrative Event Logs are completely separate from your Windows Events Log, but contains some of the same events. The Administrative Event Logs contain information only about [!DNL Insight Server] events.

**To view events.txt files through the [!DNL Server Files Manager]** 

1. In [!DNL Insight], on the [!DNL Admin] > [!DNL Dataset and Profile] tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Servers Manager]** thumbnail to open the Servers Manager workspace.
1. Right-click the icon of an active [!DNL Insight Server] and click **[!UICONTROL Server Files]**.
1. In the [!DNL Server Files Manager], click **[!UICONTROL Events]** to view its contents.
1. Right-click the check mark in the *server name* column next to the desired file and click **[!UICONTROL Make Local]**. A check mark appears next to the file name in the [!DNL Temp] column.
1. Right-click the check mark in the [!DNL Temp] column and click **[!UICONTROL Open]** > **[!UICONTROL in Notepad]**. The event file appears in a new Microsoft Windows Notepad window.
