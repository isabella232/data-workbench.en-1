# Re-validating the Digital Certificate{#re-validating-the-digital-certificate}

After installation, the digital certificate issued by Adobe acts as a key that enables you to run your Adobe product.

 **Recommended Frequency:** As needed

To function properly, a digital certificate must be current.

To remain current, your digital certificate must be re-validated on a regular basis (generally, every 30 days, but this can vary depending on your agreement with Adobe). If your machine has Internet access, the revalidation process is completely transparent. Your Adobe product connects automatically to the Adobe License Server and re-validates the certificate when necessary. If your machine does not have Internet access, you must download a new, validated certificate from the Adobe License Server and install it on your machine using the steps provided in [Downloading and Installing the Digital Certificates](../../../home/c-inst-svr/c-install-ins-svr/t-install-proc-inst-svr-dpu/c-dnld-dgtl-cert/c-dnld-dgtl-cert.md#concept-4f79c240492f4e52b6375b4b3bbefa17).
