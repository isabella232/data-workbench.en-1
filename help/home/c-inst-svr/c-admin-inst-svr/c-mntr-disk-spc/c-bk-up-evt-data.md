# Backing Up Event Data{#backing-up-event-data}

Event data must be backed up daily using your company’s normal backup systems and disaster recovery procedures.

 **Recommended Frequency:** Daily

[!DNL Insight Server] begins new log files at 12:00 AM GMT daily. Adobe recommends that you backup log files every day shortly after 12:00 AM GMT so that you capture all of the data from the previous day. For example, backing up all log files at 12:05 AM GMT on December 15th captures all of the data from December 14th. [!DNL Insight Server] does not need to be stopped during log file backups, and all functionality remains available.
