# Monitoring Dataset Data Space{#monitoring-dataset-data-space}

Information about dataset monitoring and adding new locations for dataset data storage.

 **Recommended Frequency:** Every 5-10 minutes

By default, [!DNL Insight Server] writes its dataset to the [!DNL temp.db] file on the same drive as the [!DNL Insight Server] program files on the Data Processing Unit. The amount of dataset data per [!DNL Insight Server] machine is limited to the following, whichever occurs first:

* Five hundred (500) million records of data input to that dataset 
* Five hundred (500) GB of dataset data stored 
* One (1) MB of dataset data stored per any one root-level dimension (for example, 5,000 records per Visitor at an average 200 bytes per record)

If you want [!DNL Insight Server] to maintain the dataset on a different drive, or if the amount of data you expect to collect requires the use of multiple drives, you must update the Disk Files configuration file ( [!DNL Disk Files.cfg]) to specify where you want [!DNL Insight Server] to write the [!DNL temp.db] file(s). The [!DNL Disk Files.cfg] file lists the disk files (a vector of strings) and specifies the location of the dataset data used by [!DNL Insight Server] during reprocessing and operation. There is usually one file per physical drive.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The contents of the [!DNL Disk Files.cfg] file may have been modified while installing [!DNL Insight Server]. For more information, see [Configuring the Location of the Dataset (temp.db)](../../../../home/c-inst-svr/c-install-ins-svr/t-install-proc-inst-svr-dpu/t-cfg-loc-dtst.md#task-f645eefecb154e679acbb480a07c1f0e).

**To add new locations for dataset data storage** 

1. In [!DNL Insight], on the [!DNL Admin] > [!DNL Dataset and Profile] tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Servers Manager]** thumbnail to open the Servers Manager workspace.
1. Right-click the icon of the [!DNL Insight Server] you want to configure and click **[!UICONTROL Server Files]**.
1. In the [!DNL Server Files Manager], click **[!UICONTROL Components]** to view its contents. The [!DNL Disk Files.cfg] file is located within this directory.
1. Right-click the check mark in the *server name* column for [!DNL Disk Files.cfg] and click **[!UICONTROL Make Local]**. A check mark appears in the [!DNL Temp] column for [!DNL Disk Files.cfg].
1. Right-click the newly created check mark in the [!DNL Temp] column and click **[!UICONTROL Open]** > **[!UICONTROL in Insight]**.
1. In the [!DNL Disk Files.cfg] window, click **[!UICONTROL component]** to view its contents.

   >The Detect Disk Corruption parameter is set to true by default. The Disk Cache Size (MB) parameter controls the amount of memory that [!DNL Insight Server] uses to increase disk access speed and is set to 128 by default. Please contact Adobe before changing either of these parameters.

1. To change the disk files on the [!DNL Insight Server] machine, right-click **[!UICONTROL Disk Files]** and click **[!UICONTROL Add new]** > **[!UICONTROL Disk File]**.

   To delete a disk file, right-click the disk file number and click **[!UICONTROL Remove]**. 

1. For the new disk file, enter the directory and name of the file to be used by [!DNL Insight Server] during reprocessing and operation.

1. Save your changes to the server by doing the following:

    1. Right-click **[!UICONTROL (modified)]** at the top of the window and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**. 
    
    1. In the [!DNL Server Files Manager], right-click the check mark for the file in the [!DNL Temp] column and select **[!UICONTROL Save to]** > *< **[!UICONTROL server name]**>*.
