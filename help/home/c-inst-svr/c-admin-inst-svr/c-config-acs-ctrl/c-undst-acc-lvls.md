# Understanding Access Levels{#understanding-access-levels}

Access levels describe which URIs on the machine a group of users is permitted to read or modify.

 Follow these guidelines to define access levels as desired for your organizationâ€™s users:

* Specific URIs with no trailing slash character restrict access to that URI only. For example, [!DNL /Components/Communications.cfg] provides access to the [!DNL Communications.cfg]file only. 

* A trailing slash (/), specifying a directory, provides group members access to any URI that begins with that string. For example, /Profiles/ provides access to the entire Profiles directory. 
* A trailing dollar sign symbol ($) restricts access to the exact URI only, even if it is a directory. For example, /Profiles/$ provides access to read the main Profiles directory, but not to read any files within that directory.

  For access to specific files, you do not need to use a trailing $.

  For example, [!DNL /Components/Communications.cfg] and [!DNL /Components/Communications.cfg$] provide the same access. 

* A percent symbol (%) can be used with CN (Common Name) to permit access. For example, /Users/%CN%/ allows access to the User directory matching the SSL certificate common name of the [!DNL Insight] user. Note that this syntax can be used only once in a URI.

The URIs in the pre-defined access control groups have been configured as follows:

**To configure Access Control**

When defining access control groups, you need to include all System Administrators, users, cluster servers, and Report Server users that require access to this [!DNL Insight Server] computer. You can grant access using IP address or SSL certificate information, such as the common name or organization.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When the [!DNL Access Control.cfg] file is changed on [!DNL Insight Server], all existing connections are terminated and forced to reconnect. Connections are checked against the permissions in the updated [!DNL Access Control.cfg] file. In the Servers Manager interface, the [!DNL Insight Server] icon turns red temporarily and then green again because connection is terminated and forced to reconnect along with all others.

1. On the [!DNL Admin] > [!DNL Dataset and Profile] tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Servers Manager]** thumbnail to open the Servers Manager workspace. 

1. Right-click the icon of the [!DNL Insight Server] you want to configure and click **[!UICONTROL Files]**. 

1. In the [!DNL Server Files Manager], click **[!UICONTROL Access Control]** to view its contents. The [!DNL Access Control.cfg] file is located within this directory. 

1. Right-click the check mark in the *server name* column for [!DNL Access Control.cfg] and click **[!UICONTROL Make Local]**. A check mark appears in the [!DNL Temp] column for [!DNL Access Control.cfg]. 

1. Right-click the newly created check mark in the [!DNL Temp] column and click **[!UICONTROL Open]** > **[!UICONTROL in Workstation]**. 

1. In the [!DNL Access Control.cfg] window, click **[!UICONTROL Access Control Groups]** to view its contents.

1. To add a new access control group:

    1. Right-click **[!UICONTROL Access Control Groups]** and click **[!UICONTROL Add new]** > **[!UICONTROL Group]**. 
    
    1. Right-click **[!UICONTROL Members]** and click **[!UICONTROL Add new]** > **[!UICONTROL Member]**.

       The members for the default groups are not pre-defined. By default, Administrator access is granted to 127.0.0.1 (local host), and [!DNL Sensor] access is granted to IP:&#42;. All other access control group members must be defined. 
    
    1. Complete the parameters.

1. To add new members to an existing access control group:

    1. Right-click **[!UICONTROL Members]** under the appropriate access control group and click **[!UICONTROL Add new]** > **[!UICONTROL Member]**.

1. Save the file by right-clicking **[!UICONTROL (modified)]** at the top of the window and then clicking **[!UICONTROL Save]**. 

1. To save the locally made changes to the [!DNL Insight Server] machine, in the [!DNL Server Files Manager], right-click the check mark for [!DNL Access Control.cfg] in the [!DNL Temp] column, then click **[!UICONTROL Save to]** *< **[!UICONTROL server name]**>*.
