# Confirming Your Systems Are Healthy{#confirming-your-systems-are-healthy}

You must ensure that the machines on which Adobe server products are installed meet the minimum system requirements as defined in the Minimum System Requirements document.

 **Recommended Frequency:** Every 5-10 minutes

You also must monitor your systems according to the best practices for operating that particular hardware, including, but not limited to, monitoring the following:

* CPU usage 
* Disk space 
* Hardware system messages 
* Internal system temperature 
* Memory usage 
* Power supply conditions 
* RAID or disk controller performance and errors

Adobe recommends that you configure your management tool to alert administrators when any system parameter on a server machine exceeds the threshold you have set.

For [!DNL Insight Server] machines, Adobe also recommends that you configure each [!DNL Insight Server] to indicate when it reaches the minimum disk space limit you have set. For more information about these alerts, see [Configuring Administrative Alerts](../../../home/c-inst-svr/c-admin-inst-svr/t-config-adm-alrts.md#task-0858f588da4941aa9d4952f6592681aa).
