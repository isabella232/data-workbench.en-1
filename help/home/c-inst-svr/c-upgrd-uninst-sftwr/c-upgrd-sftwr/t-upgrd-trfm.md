# Upgrading Transform{#upgrading-transform}

Steps to upgrade the Transform folder.

1. Open the [!DNL .zip] file for the [!DNL Insight Server] release package, and open the [!DNL Profiles] folder within that [!DNL .zip] file.
1. Copy the [!DNL Transform] folder to the [!DNL Profiles] folder in your [!DNL Insight Server] installation directory. Doing this overwrites the existing [!DNL Transform] folder.
1. For each profile that inherits the [!DNL Transform] profile, confirm that the [!DNL profile.cfg] file has a “Transform” entry in the Directories vector.
Data reprocessing begins after synchronization of the profile.
