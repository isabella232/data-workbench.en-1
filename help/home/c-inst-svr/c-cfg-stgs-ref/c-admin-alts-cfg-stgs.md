   <td colname="col2"> Lets you categorize errors in conjunction with the Error Categorization File. Each Error Category can have its own set of Recipients and its own Throttle Delay. For example, you might create a Critical category with a throttle delay of 0, so that every critical error is emailed immediately to the recipients specified in the Recipients list. Errors that do not match a substring in the Error Categorization File are assigned to the Default category. To add a new category, right-click on a number and click <span class="uicontrol"> Add New </span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol"> Error Category </span>. You can also copy or remove them using the right-click action. </td>

   <td colname="col2"> <p>The name of the file you want to use to categorize each alert. You create this file using Notepad. This file should have three columns on each line, separated by tabs. The first column is a string to match in errors. A ^ sign matches the beginning and a $ matches the end of the string; all other characters are matched literally. The second column is a category for errors that match, which is in Error Categories. The third is an alternate message, which is prepended to the actual error message in emails that are sent. If no file is specified, all errors categorize as Default. </p> <p>To see an example of this file, see the <span class="filepath"> Error Categories.txt </span> file in the Lookups directory. </p> </td>
