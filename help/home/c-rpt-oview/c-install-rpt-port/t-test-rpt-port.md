Steps to open the Report Portal and ensure that you can successfully view the reports for your profile.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can not log into the [!DNL Report Portal] until reports appear in the Output folder.

1. From your web browser, open the [!DNL Report Portal] using the following URI format:

   https://*ServerAddress*/*PortalName*

   Example: [!DNL https://localhost/VisualReportPortal]

1. If [!DNL Report Portal] prompts you for log-in credentials, enter an account name and password (for example, account “test” and password “user” for the default account).
1. When the [!DNL Report Portal] appears, verify that:

    * The portal contains a tab for each report set in the output folder.
    * Each tab displays the report set’s summary report.
    * The menu on each tab lists the individual subfolders (if any) for the report set and displays the contents of those folders.
