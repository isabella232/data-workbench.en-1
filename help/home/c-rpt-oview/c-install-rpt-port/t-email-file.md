# Edit the Email.asp File{#edit-the-email-asp-file}

Access to and permissions within your Report Portal are controlled using individual user and group accounts.

 Each time that you add a new account or edit an existing account, a confirmation email can be sent to the email address that you specify for that account (see [Working with Accounts](../../../home/c-rpt-oview/c-admin-rpt/c-work-accts/c-work-accts.md#concept-c933a1940bda4a3489d61d8af315e45d)) and copied to the email addresses that you specify in the [!DNL email.asp] file.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Notification emails are sent to account users only when you have specified an email address for the account and properly configured the [!DNL email.asp] file. If you do not want notification emails sent for an account, leave the accountâ€™s email field blank.

This file resides in the `\*PortalName*\PortalASP` folder.

1. On the machine where IIS is running, open the [!DNL email.asp] file in a text editor such as Notepad.
1. Set the following variables:

<table id="table_44F52DA266364DF993C40678A28E0F0D">

   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> For this variable . . . </th>
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Provide this information . . . </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td colname="col1"> smtpserver </td>

Use this value if the SMTP service is not installed on the computer where the script is running. </p> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
