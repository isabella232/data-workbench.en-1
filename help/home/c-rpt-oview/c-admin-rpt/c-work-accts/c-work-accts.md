# Working with Accounts{#working-with-accounts}

Access to and permissions within your Report Portal are controlled using individual user and group accounts.

 Certain users can be designated as administrators, enabling them to manage all of the accounts.

Both individual user and group accounts specify which profiles and tabs that particular user or group can access. The main difference is that individual accounts enable users to reset their passwords, while group account passwords can be reset only by a [!DNL Report Portal] administrator.

The following sections provide you with the information that you need to view, create, and edit individual user and group accounts.
