# Monitoring Disk Space{#monitoring-disk-space}

You should regularly monitor available disk space so that all Report Server machines continue to perform at the highest level possible.

Each [!DNL Report Server] machine stores the following types of data:

* Operating system data 
* Report data 
* System data

>[!NOTE]

>Adobe consultants can evaluate your use scenario to help you project the amount of data storage that your Adobe software application generates and requires. To request such an evaluation, please contact Adobe Consulting Services.

* [Monitoring Report Data Space](../../../home/c-rpt-oview/c-admin-rpt/c-mon-disk-sp.md#section-ad0a63f3a6824e68acd675da0b6c5c23) 
* [Backing Up Operating System, Report, and System Data](../../../home/c-rpt-oview/c-admin-rpt/c-mon-disk-sp.md#section-b5efb132ca5d4ee69a8608f9b4ab245b)

## Monitoring Report Data Space {#section-ad0a63f3a6824e68acd675da0b6c5c23}

**Recommended Frequency:** Every 5-10 minutes

Make sure that you provide enough disk space to accommodate your reports in the [!DNL Reports] folder within the [!DNL Report] installation directory.

## Backing Up Operating System, Report, and System Data {#section-b5efb132ca5d4ee69a8608f9b4ab245b}

**Recommended Frequency:** Daily

Report, system, and operating system data must be backed up regularly and diligently using your company’s normal back up and disaster recovery systems.
