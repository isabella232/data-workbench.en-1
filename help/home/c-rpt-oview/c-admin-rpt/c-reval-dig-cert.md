# Re-validating the Digital Certificate{#re-validating-the-digital-certificate}

After installation, the digital certificate issued by Adobe acts as a key that enables you to run Report Server.

 **Recommended Frequency:** As needed

To function properly, a digital certificate must be current.

To remain current, your digital certificate must be re-validated on a regular basis (generally, every 30 days, but this can vary depending on your agreement with Adobe). If your machine has Internet access, the revalidation process is completely transparent. [!DNL Report Server] connects automatically to the Adobe License Server and re-validates the certificate when necessary. If your machine does not have Internet access, you must download a new, validated certificate from the Adobe License Server and install it on your machine using the steps provided in [Downloading and Installing the Digital Certificate](../../../home/c-rpt-oview/c-inst-rpt/c-install-dig-cert/c-install-dig-cert.md#concept-5a61fc67df3643598c7c403962075f76).
