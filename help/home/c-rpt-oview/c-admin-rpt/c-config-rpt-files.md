# Configuring Report.cfg Files{#configuring-report-cfg-files}

In the Report Portal, you can view reports generated by Report Server as Excel files (.xls or .xlsx) or .png files.

 To display a report set in the [!DNL Report Portal], you must set the following parameters in the [!DNL Report.cfg] file for that report set:

* In the **[!UICONTROL Output Root]** parameter, specify the document root of the web server used for your portal. 
* In the **[!UICONTROL Report Types]** parameter, specify Excel, png, and/or thumbnail as the report types that you want to generate.

When [!DNL Report Server] generates the reports in the formats that you specified, it places those files in the document root of the web server, which is where during installation you configure the [!DNL Report Portal] to access the reports.

For more information about the specific [!DNL Report.cfg] parameters, see [Report.cfg Parameters](../../../home/c-rpt-oview/c-rpt-param-ref/c-rpt-param.md#concept-838e59d72d3f4cb29ee15f5c7eb0ceff).
