# Data Workbench Report Server{#data-workbench-report-server}

Using the Report Server for Data Workbench, you can schedule and automatically generate report sets and distribute to others.

 For example, you can create a status report containing the particular visualizations that members of upper management are interested in seeing and then distribute the resulting report to the appropriate executives.

You can also create reports that alert you when a metric has reached a defined threshold within a specified time frame. For example, you can create a report that alerts you when the number of orders for the previous day was less than 10 or greater than 100.
