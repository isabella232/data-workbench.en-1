1. On the login screen, enter the Account Name and the Password that you received from Adobe, then click **[!UICONTROL login]**.
1. Locate the certificate that has been issued for your instance of [!DNL Report] Server (*Your Name*.pem) and click the ![](assets/btn_save_certificatedownload.PNG) icon associated with that certificate.
1. When prompted to save the certificate, click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
1. Download the file to the Certificates folder in the directory where you installed [!DNL Report Server].
