The final step in creating a report set is to publish the newly created report set to the data workbench server machine.

 **To upload the report set to the data workbench server** 

1. On the [!DNL Reports] tab, right-click one of the reports that you want to upload and click **[!UICONTROL Save to server]** > **[!UICONTROL Yes]**.
1. Repeat this step for each report to be uploaded to the data workbench server machine.
[!DNL Report] will now generate any reports that you defined according to the schedule that you specified in the [!DNL Report.cfg] file.
