# Editing Existing Report.cfg Files{#editing-existing-report-cfg-files}

Steps to edit existing Report.cfg files using Worktop or a text editor.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* You must be working online to edit [!DNL Report.cfg] files. To work online, from the [!DNL Worktop], right-click the title bar and click **[!UICONTROL Work Online]**. 
>
>* If the **[!UICONTROL Allow Report Regeneration]** parameter in the [!DNL Report.cfg] file is set to [!DNL True], when you make changes to that file and save that file back to the server, [!DNL Report] automatically re-generates the reports in that set. Although it regenerates the reports, it does not re-send the reports via email. For steps to do so, see [Resending Reports by Email](../../../../home/c-rpt-oview/c-work-rpt-sets/c-edit-ex-rpt-files/t-res-rpts-email.md#task-b0a21f1c925f4e5d82560581ae4cf607).

You can edit an existing [!DNL Report.cfg] from the [!DNL Worktop] or using a text editor.

Editing a [!DNL Report.cfg] file using the [!DNL Reports] tab of the [!DNL Worktop] enables you to edit only those parameters, vectors, and vector items that already exist in the file. If you need to add a parameter or vector to the file, you must edit it using a text editor, such as Notepad.
