# Understanding Report Sets{#understanding-report-sets}

A report set is a collection of workspaces that Report Server generates based on the values specified in a Report.cfg configuration file.

In your [!DNL Insight] installation folder, each subfolder within the <*working profile name*>\Reports folder represents a report set that has been created. Each report set has its own [!DNL Report.cfg] configuration file within that subfolder.

>[!NOTE]
>
>In the [!DNL Profile Manager] in Data Workbench, report sets appear as subfolders within the [!DNL Reports] folder. For more information about the [!DNL Profile Manager], see the [Data Workbench User Guide](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/data-workbench/using/home.html#Data_Workbench_Help).

By defining specific configuration settings for a report set in its [!DNL Report.cfg] file, you can schedule the creation and distribution of the reports, including who receives which reports and in what formats.
