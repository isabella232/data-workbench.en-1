# Report Server.cfg Parameters{#report-server-cfg-parameters}

Information about Report Server.cfg parameters.

The sample [!DNL Report Server.cfg] shown in [Configuring the Connection to Insight Server](../../../home/c-rpt-oview/c-inst-rpt/t-config-conn-ins-svr.md#task-a3ca949c43244782b658fb4437fd724c) contains only the parameters included in the [!DNL Report Server.cfg] file by default.

If you contact the Adobe License Server through a proxy server, you need to add the Licensing vector and its parameters to the [!DNL Report Server.cfg]. Following is an example of this vector and its parameters that you can use a model for your Licensing vector: 

```
Licensing = serverInfo:  
Proxy Address = string: ProxyIPAddress 
Proxy Password = string: ProxyPassword 
Proxy Port = int: ProxyPort 
Proxy User Name = string: ProxyUserName 

```

The following table provides descriptions of the [!DNL Report Server.cfg] file parameters:

The default value is 120 seconds. </p> <p>Example: Workspace queries are 62.145672% complete. </p> <p>Completion messages are written to the <span class="filepath"> reportserver.log </span> and are synched to the server. This setting controls the <span class="filepath"> status.txt </span> files that are sent back and forth for each report set, so that the percent complete can be shown with thumbnails. The messages are sent whenever a report set completes or when the interval is reached, whichever comes first. Setting this higher does not effect the rate at which you see report generated in the client interface by the thumbnails, but does effect how many interim messages you see. Specifying a low value can cause the system to spend a large amount of time synchronizing data, because data is synched from <span class="keyword"> Report Server </span> server to the profile, across all the DPUs and to all connected clients each time a <span class="filepath"> status.txt </span> message changes. </p> <p>The system always sends a <span class="filepath"> status.txt </span> file when a report set completes, regardless of the setting of this configuration parameter. </p> </td>

It is not recommended to set this to a small value, such as two minutes, because a reporting queue can take hours to run. In that case, you might consider a setting of 600 to 1200 seconds. </p> <p>For more information about <span class="wintitle"> Detailed Status </span>, see the Administrative Interfaces chapter of the <a href="https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/data-workbench/using/client/admin-ui/c-admin-intrf.html" format="http" scope="external"> Insight User Guide </a>. </p> </td>

The default value is 10 minutes. </p> <p>The time that you specify is divided among all of the profiles listed. For example, if your interval is set to 10 minutes and you are monitoring two profiles, each profile is monitored for 5 minutes. If a profile is being monitored when a new or modified report or alert is saved to the profile, the report or alert is immediately available for generation. </p> <p>If the <span class="wintitle"> Update Interval </span> is configured to monitor more than one profile, it is important that this setting is high enough to load all profiles within the configured time. In systems with many large dimensions configured, for example, where it might take several minutes to retrieve the initial data connection with all the element names, this setting must be long enough for that full synchronization to occur. Otherwise, the system issues a profile synch error. </p> </td>
