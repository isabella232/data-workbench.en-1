# Data Workbench 6.52 Update{#data-workbench-update}

Data Workbench 6.52 release notes.

## Upgrade Issue {#section-2309288964f8409ea3695564d92e034b}

AVRO upgraded for processing data source log files.  

## Fixed Bugs {#section-3c47f9177e9d40d8938a5710399dc88f}

* Fixed issue where the same decoder name was used for AVRO sources (decoders must be unique).

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Error message will now display if you do not have a unique decoder for every log path.

## Known Issues {#section-8089318f885c4709ad0dd033f322a714}

* If you have an older version of the workstation and choose to reprocess a profile, you will get a false warning—a "Decoders must be unique" error will display although you actually have unique decoders. You can exit and relaunch the workstation and the error will no longer appear, or upgrade to this version of the workstation (client) as a permanent fix.
