## Upgrade Requirements {#section-84f8f38e9c424d7788c79146fce5a6fe}

Follow these requirements and recommendations when upgrading to Data Workbench 6.5.

* Changes in the **`Components for Processing Servers\Communications.cfg`** file require you to update this file for the DWB 6.5 release. The *SourceListServer*, *SegmentExportServer*, and *NormalizeServer* entries were removed. (DPU's should not be running *sourcelist*, *segment export*, or *normalize servers*. )

## System Updates {#section-bcdd732af53249b893d30bb42eeb14fc}

These features have been renamed, deleted, or the installation files or folders were restructured in this release:

* Correlation Chord, Correlation Matrix, Association Chord, Association Matrix, Propensity Score, and Best Fit Attribution visualizations are now **multi-pass visualizations**, allowing them to run in Report Server. 

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >You can only have one multi-pass visualization in a workspace. 
  >
  >When there are more than one multi-pass visualizations in a workspace, Report Server will fail to generate reports by default and throw the following error: 
  >
  >```
  >Too many Multipass visualizations in workspace ....... (has #, 1 allowed).
  >```
  >
  >Avoid this error by updating your [!DNL ReportServer.cfg] file or add this line to your existing file in the *Reporting* section.   >
  >
  >```
  >Max Multipass Per Slice = int: 1
  >```
  >
  >The *Max Multipass Per Slice* value must remain set at 1 (See *Known Issues*).

* Changes made to files in the [!DNL Server\Menu\Admin] folder.

    * Removed Lookups. 
    * Added Archive Files and User Files. 
    * Modified Files, Export Files, Log Files.

  Updated files include: 

  ```
  Base\Menu\Admin\Order.txt (changes to menu)
  ```

  ```
  Base\Menu\Admin\Files.vw (removed Lookups and Events string, added 
  Archive and Users strings)
  ```

  ```
  Base\Menu\Admin\Archive Files.vw
  ```

  ```
  Base\Menu\Admin\User Files.vw
  ```

* Changes made to files in the [!DNL Base\Context\ServerDetails] folder: 

  ```
  Base\Context\ServerDetails\Archive Files.vw
  ```

  ```
  Base\Context\ServerDetails\Export Files.vw
  ```

  ```
  Base\Context\ServerDetails\Log Files.vw
  ```

  ```
  Base\Context\ServerDetails\User Files.vw
  ```

  ```
  Base\Context\serverdetails\files.vw
  ```

  ```
  Base\workspaces\admin\dataset and profile\server files.vw
  ```

* Changes made to the [self-administration of member access](/help/home/c-release-notes-insight/c-6-5.md).

  A new file in the *Base* and *Server* packages includes a [!DNL User List.cfg] for Admins to update for member access.

## Fixed Bugs {#section-3c47f9177e9d40d8938a5710399dc88f}

The following are prominent fixes made in Data Workbench 6.5 (since the release of Data Workbench 6.4).

* Fixed block decoding bug that was introduced in release 6.4. Issue was encountered during processing of a very large visitor. 
* Fixed alignment bug introduced with compiler upgrade. Issue affected Replication in release 6.4

## Known Issues {#section-350ae121ca3442babbef4d0a2b027df1}

* Use of the *Windows Certificate Store* is limited to the English only (no Chinese or Japanese language support). 
* *Regression Analysis* on graphs does not recognize new workspace selections. A possible workaround is to redo the regression after making a new selection. 
* The *Max Multipass Per Slice* value must remain set at 1. You cannot have more than one of the following visualizations in a single workspace intended for Report Server: Propensity Score, Best Fit Attribution, Association Matrix, Association Chord, Correlation Matrix, or Correlation Chord.
