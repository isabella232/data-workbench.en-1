## Upgrade Requirements {#section-e1aa5adcf5f24a3da795574364ea196b}

**Workstation (client) upgrade requirements:**

To upgrade the client workstation for version 6.51 from version 6.50, you must run the Workstation Setup Wizard to install the workstation executable and supporting files (using the** Upgrade or repair** mode)—or copy or edit files manually on your server. For this upgrade only, the automated upgrade feature in the workstation from the *Software and Docs* profile is turned off (even though the [!DNL Update software = true] is set in the [!DNL Insight.cfg] file on your server).

** Server upgrade requirements: **

Update to the new **[!DNL Adobe SC meta.cfg]** file:

* The [!DNL server\Profiles\Adobe SC\Context\]**[!DNL meta.cfg]** file was renamed to [!DNL server\Profiles\Adobe SC\Context\]**[!DNL Adobe SC meta.cfg]**. 

* Updated [!DNL Base\Context\] **[!DNL meta.cfg]** file.

Replace your server build with the updated files.

## System Updates {#section-84f8f38e9c424d7788c79146fce5a6fe}

These features have been renamed, deleted, or the installation files or folders were restructured in this release:

* **SSL Connectivity Change**. Certificate generation to upgrade key length was modified to 2048 bits and uses SHA256. This eliminates RC4 ciphers by using modern encryption algorithms. 
* Files changed to Read-only.

    * base\context\serverdetails\detailed status.vw 
    * base\menu\admin\detailed status for master.vw 
    * base\menu\admin\detailed status for query.vw 
    * base\workspaces\admin\dataset and profile\detailed status.vw

* **Bookmarks alphabetized**. Right-click in the Bookmark panel and select **Alphabetize**. The bookmarks will align based on alphabetic, case-insensitive characters for each language.

## Fixed Bugs {#section-3c47f9177e9d40d8938a5710399dc88f}

The following are prominent fixes made in Data Workbench 6.51 (since the release of Data Workbench 6.5).

* Previously, **Algorithmic Attribution** coefficients displayed as all zeros when using SGD to converge. This is now fixed.

## Known Issues {#section-49ab5451d0c74f36a69ca12621251674}

* Exporting an Association Table from an [Association Chord](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/insight/client/?f=associations-chord)visualization that contains *at least one metric* will result in duplicated elements in the rows/columns of the Association Table. To avoid duplicated elements, create a new Association Table and add the desired elements rather than exporting the elements from an Association Chord. 

* If you build an Avro decoder, the default field button won’t work. Please work with your account manager to get the appropriate configuration for your implementation. 
* Upgrading the workstation (client) from DWB 6.50 must be done manually using the Client Setup Wizard in Upgrade mode). And automatic upgrade will not occur (see Upgrade Requirements for the client). 
* Using the Chinese and Japanese install packages for Adobe SC AVRO as a stand-alone might give an error stating [!DNL Undefined Metric: "$Default Metric$"]. No mapping is currently defined for [!DNL $Default Metric$]. However, if you are using the Adobe SC AVRO package along with other packages, such as the Attribution-Premium package, then this error will not occur.
