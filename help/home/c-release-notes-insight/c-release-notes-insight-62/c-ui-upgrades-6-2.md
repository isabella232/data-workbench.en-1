## New Bookmark Features {#section-e361b605441540ca8213c3fddb5e0718}

You can now bookmark significant workspaces to quickly move between visualizations and reports employed in your workflow.

**Working with Bookmarks**

1. Bookmark a workspace by clicking the Bookmark icon ![](assets/bookmark_icon.png) in the upper right corner of the toolbar. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]** > **[!UICONTROL Bookmarks Panel]** in the left pane to open a list of bookmarks.

   ![](assets/bookmarks_panel_left.png)

   The selected workspace will open. When you click another bookmarked workspace, the previous workspace will close and the newly selected workspace will open, allowing you to quickly navigate through your workflow.

**To delete a bookmark:**

* In the Bookmark Panel, right-click and select **[!UICONTROL Remove <bookmark title>]** to delete a selected bookmark, or select **[!UICONTROL Clear All Bookmarks]** to delete all bookmarks. 

* You can also right-click on the workspace in the thumbnail view within the worktop and select **[!UICONTROL Clear Bookmark]**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>* 25 bookmarks can be saved. 
>* If you add a bookmark and then move the location of the workspace, the bookmark will be invalid and must be deleted from the Bookmark Panel and reset.

## New Icons in Workspace {#section-c108bbd1661249e79c146727ff3d2470}

Data Workbench 6.2 now replaces the text in the workspace with icons. You can still hover over and see the tool tip message identifying the icon, including **[!UICONTROL File]**, **[!UICONTROL Add]**, and **[!UICONTROL Export]**.

A new **[!UICONTROL Help]** icon is added to access the documentation and other knowledge centers, including the following links:

## Drag Workspace Views {#section-9129c340c21d45a3864c923884cd4382}

If a workspace is larger than the viewable screen, you can move the view to see all elements within the workspace. You can click in the background (outside of the visualizations and tables) and drag the screen to move the viewable area within the workspace. The cursor will change to a hand icon when dragging the view within the workspace frame.

## Quick Keys to Change Workspace Views {#section-d8322f72423f437aa2e34f2188b1341c}

New quick keys let you resize and refit workspaces between window and full page views. See the [Quick Reference](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/insight/client/c_qk_ref.html) for more keyboard quick keys.
