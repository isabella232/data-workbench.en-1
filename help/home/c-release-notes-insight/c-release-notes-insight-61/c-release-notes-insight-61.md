|Statistical Callouts|Tables now offer a statistics summary call-out for metric columns. The call-out can display the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, variance, and total count for the column. It can be factored in to any selection and evaluation.|
|Correlation Matrix filter|The Correlation Matrix has been updated with a  Binary Filter to let you constrain values for one or both of the correlated metrics, allowing you to better focus your comparison. Also, you can now add Dimension elements from a Dimension table by clicking Ctrl + Alt and dragging elements to the matrix column or row to be evaluated.|
|Hide Fallout label in funnel visualization|Toggle between displaying and hiding fallout labels in a Funnel visualization by right-clicking the title and selecting  Hide Fallout.|

## Sorting Table Columns{#sorting-table-columns}

Sort table columns alphabetically or by ordinals.

To better select elements in a Dimension table, you can order the first column alphabetically or by ordinals by selecting the **[!UICONTROL Sort]** menu option.

The # character will display when a column is sorted by ordinals (the default).

**Select Sort Option**

To change sorting options between ordinal and alphabet, right-click and select **[!UICONTROL Sort]**. Click the arrow to reverse the order.

>You can sort other columns by ordinal by clicking the name of the column.

## Hide Fallout Labels in Funnel

Toggle to open fallout labels in a Funnel visualization.

The Funnel visualization identifies where a customer abandons a marketing campaign or diverts from a defined conversion path while interacting with your website or cross-channel campaign. The left side of the Funnel visualization displays the results of a visit or visitors, while the right side displays the "Fallout" of those who abandon a specified path.

When in a **[!UICONTROL Funnel]** visualization, you can right-click the title and select **[!UICONTROL Hide Fallout]** from the menu to hide the fallout labels.

  Workaround: Click OK to ignore the error. The workspace is imported successfully.

**Simplified Chinese Localization Issues**

* The dialog title and message displayed after clicking "Submit" when setting the target in the Scoring visualization are unreadable.

  Workaround: None. 
* When using word wrap in the Worksheet visualization, localized words are not being wrapped correctly. Extra junk characters are being added to the string.
