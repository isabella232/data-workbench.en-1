# Data Workbench 6.31 Update{#data-workbench-update}

Data Workbench 6.31 provides bug fixes and identifies known issues and their workarounds.

## Bug Fixes {#section-8704a9ac358246cd81233dd0982d534f}

* Fixed issue where the **Segment Export** output contains random characters in the export file (which has been identified as random buffer data). This occurs for Segment Exports with both legacy and the new segment export formats. 
* Fixed issue where **Add Dimension** in a table was displaying only extended dimensions. Now all standard and extended dimensions are displayed. 
* Fixed issue in Simplified Chinese version where the client executable, Insight.exe, if the installation directory was named with non-English characters. 
* Fixed issues in the Report Server in the Simplified Chinese version where the email subject and the attachment file names were garbled but the actual output reports were valid.

## Known Issues {#section-8267535d92254522a19da0d3ba4e58f0}

* **Legacy Segment export files output with double quotes** even if the export file doesn't contain quotes in the Output Format field.

  *Workaround*: Add these three lines to the .export file. Setting these values will not trigger an MMP integration (as other configuration fields are required) but will bypass unwanted automatic escapes.

  ```
    MMP Configuration = MMPConfiguration:
      MMP Segment Name = string: UNESCAPE DUMMY
      MMP Visitor ID Field = string: [Specify a Dimension from the output of
                                      the current export]
  ```

  (The first line has two (2) leading spaces and the next lines four (4). The Dimension from the output of the current export needs to be referenced in the [!DNL MMP Visitor ID Field].)
