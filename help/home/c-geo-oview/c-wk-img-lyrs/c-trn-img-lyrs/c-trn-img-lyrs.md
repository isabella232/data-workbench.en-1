# Working with Terrain Image Layers{#working-with-terrain-image-layers}

In data workbench, a terrain image layer displays terrain imagery of the Earth.

Terrain image layers are stored in the [!DNL Geography] profile, in a custom format. These image layers can be generated by Adobe, or data workbench server can transform your user-supplied terrain imagery into terrain layers suitable for use on the globe visualization.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To work with terrain image layers, you must install the [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg] file provided by Adobe. For installation instructions, see [Installing Data Workbench Geography](../../../../home/c-geo-oview/c-inst-geo/c-inst-geo.md#concept-0c093b4c2a6b469a831588cd4a272a91).

To define a terrain image layer, you must have the following:

* **One or more terrain image files** containing the images to be displayed on the globe. 
* **A Terrain Images.cfg** file that specifies the terrain image file(s) to be used for the layer(s). The [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg] file enables you to add one or more sources to create a terrain image layer. The format of your terrain image file determines the type of source that you should add. The following table provides descriptions of the available terrain image layer sources, including the supported terrain image file formats:

**To define a terrain image layer**

1. In data workbench, on the [!DNL Admin] > [!DNL Dataset and Profile] tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Servers Manager]** thumbnail to open the [!DNL Servers Manager] workspace. 

1. Within the [!DNL Servers Manager] window, right-click the icon of the desired data workbench server and click **[!UICONTROL Server Files]**. 

1. In the [!DNL Server Files Manager], click **[!UICONTROL Components]** to view its contents. The [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg] file is located within this directory. 

1. Right-click the check mark in the server name column for [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg], then click **[!UICONTROL Make Local]**. A check mark appears in the [!DNL Temp] column for [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg.] 

1. Right-click the newly created check mark in the [!DNL Temp] column and click **[!UICONTROL Open]** > **[!UICONTROL from the workbench]**. The [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg]window appears. 

1. In the [!DNL Terrain Images] window, click **[!UICONTROL component]** to view its contents. 

1. Right-click **[!UICONTROL Sources]** > **[!UICONTROL Add new]** and choose one of the following source types:

    * **[!UICONTROL Raw unprojected bitmap]**. (Once added, this source type is labeled RawTerrainSource in the [!DNL Terrain Images] window.) 
    
    * **[!UICONTROL General image, unprojected]**. (Once added, this source type is labeled GDALTerrainSource in the [!DNL Terrain Images] window.) 
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Image with embedded projection]**. (Once added, this source type is labeled GDALTerrainSource in the [!DNL Terrain Images] window.)

1. Edit the parameters for the source as necessary using the following sample file and table of parameters as guides.

1. Edit the Source Image Location, Temp Image Storage, and Write Layers To parameters using the following table as a guide. These parameters apply to all of the terrain image sources that you define in the Sources section of this file.

   |  Parameter  | Description  |
   |---|---|
   |  Source Image Location  | Required. The directory that is scanned for images to translate into terrain layers. If it is not an absolute path, it is interpreted relative to the data workbench server installation directory.  |
   |  Temp Image Storage  | Optional. The name of a directory that is used for storage of temporary files used in the translation of source images to terrain layers. If it is not an absolute path, it is interpreted relative to the data workbench server installation directory. The default location is the Temp directory.  |
   |  Write Layers To  |Required. The directory to which terrain layers are output. Ordinarily, this is the Maps subdirectory of a profile directory, so that the [!DNL Globe] visualization can find the layers.  |

1. Save the file by right-clicking **[!UICONTROL (modified)]** at the top of the window and clicking **[!UICONTROL Save]**. 

1. To save updated file to the data workbench server machine, in the [!DNL Server Files Manager], right-click the check mark for [!DNL Terrain Images.cfg] in the [!DNL Temp] column, then click **[!UICONTROL Save to]** > *< **[!UICONTROL server name]**>*.
