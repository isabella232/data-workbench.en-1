# About the Data Services{#about-the-data-services}

Information about data service options for mapping IP addresses.

If you are using an Adobe application, have licensed data workbench [!DNL Geography], and want to map IP addresses on the globe or create visualizations showing geographically related dimensions of data (for example, area code, time zone, MSA) that are based on IP address, you can subscribe to one of two optional data services:

* IP Geo-intelligence data service (offered by Adobe, provided by Digital Envoy) 
* IP Geo-location data service (offered by Adobe, provided by Quova)

Each data service provides you with a profile containing additional dimensions of data (such as Area Code, MSA, and Time Zone) and the supporting lookup files that contain the elements of those dimensions. You can use these additional dimensions in your analysis workspaces in data workbench.
